  oop i tend to feel like that most time i tend to feel that if we  have extrem good compil tool then those tool should be abl  to do the inlin and optimis far better than i could that the  theori anyway :) and there alway a tradeoff with inlin between  speed and memori bloat (which may sometim be no tradeoff if swap  start get involved...) yes and i understand that argument howev sometim i find that if i don't tri to write code in the least space possibl or for exampl becom lazi and say --bad style bool q if(q) when i should say if(q==true) or --bad optim int a a=some_function() if(a)  appar work but is bad code style that what i mean about let the program tool take care of the coding... it consid bad appar or for exampl say you are write a loop that say number { some_thing_goes_here() number do_someth } when i probabl should say c=strlen(somestring) number { some_thing_goes_here() if(b=c) do_someth } of cours peopl alway say that the extra call to strlen() will make no differ on the machin we have these day but my machin has number of ram... not number  i'm just rant  -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
