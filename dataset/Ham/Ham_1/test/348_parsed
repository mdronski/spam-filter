  i thought perhap i should just do lilo -b /dev/hdb -r /mnt but i think  that -b is analog to the boot keyword in lilo.conf or will this just  work automag  i.e boot = /dev/hda tell lilo what number to poke  where and it figur out where the disk is from the -r  that won't work like you want you'll end up with a boot loader on the backup disk that contain the physic locat of the /boot/map file on the main disk that won't necessarili be the same as the backup disk i can't think of a right way to do his with lilo i'v got a similar seup on my home machin (rsync to a backup disk everi night) but i'll be pull out the rh instal cds to get lilo sort if i have to do a disk swap grub should be abl to handl this no problem sinc it doesn't record sector number like lilo doe not much help for you though.. later kenn -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
