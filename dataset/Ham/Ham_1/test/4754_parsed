 i want to get back to this but didn't have the time i actual live on a coupl differ indian reserv grow up in the pacif northwest and also spent a fair amount time in lakota/sioux countri as well and my parent have live on an even more divers rang of indian reserv than i have (mi experi be a direct result of live with my parents) i do get a lot of my inform first-hand or in some case second-hand from my father the incom figur for the indian are somewhat mislead most becaus it is realli hard to do proper account of the effect incom while it is true that some indian live in genuin poverti it is typic as a consequ of previous poor decis that were made by the tribe not someth that was impress upon them the primari problem with the account is that there is a tribal entiti that exist separ from the individu typic an "indian corporation" of one type or anoth where each member of the tribe own a singl share (the detail of when and how a share becom activ vari from tribe to tribe) in most tribe a dividend is paid out to each of the tribal member from the corpor usual to the tune of number per person depend on the tribe the dividend money come from a number of place with the primari sourc be the feder gov't and various businesses/asset own by the indian corpor you have to understand a coupl thing first a great mani indian tribe are run as pure communist enterpris everyon get a check for their share no matter what one of the biggest problem this has caus is veri high unemploy (often percent for tribal member who are more than happi take their dividend and not work the dividend they receiv from the corpor often constitut their sole "income" for govern account purpos unfortun to support this type of econom when no one work they'v had to sell off most of their use asset to maintain those dividend mani of the tribe genuin live in poverti do so becaus they have run out of thing to sell yet nobodi work one of the ironi is that on mani of the reserv where the tribe still have asset to burn mani of the peopl work in the store and such are actual poor white folk not indian second even though the tribe member each get a cash dividend they also receiv an enorm rang of benefit and perk from the indian corpor to the tune of ten of thousand of dollar per person annual by benefit and perk we are talk about the kind of thing no other ordinari american receiv from either their employ or the govern it should be point out that while mani of these indian corpor are inept run and most provid sinecur for other indian a minor are veri smart manag and a few hire non-indian busi execut with good credenti to run their busi divis an exampl of this is the haida corpor which while have less number tribal sharehold has billion of dollar in asset and the various corpor they own have gross revenu in the number million rang (and growing) yet the dividend paid out is strict control about number in this particular case and they engag in a practic of wait a coupl decad befor draw money from ani of the asset they were grant which has led to intellig invest and use they don't eat their seed corn and have actual manag to grow their stash in contrast a coupl island over there is anoth tribe of number peopl that has a net loss of about number million annual iirc while be regular endow by the feder govern with sever billion of dollar in valuabl asset this particular tribe has a modest incom in theori but the actual expenditur per person annual is in the hundr of thousand of dollar and mani borrow money against futur incom incident in this particular case the peopl that are work frequent pull in a few hundr thousand dollar a year much of which goe back to the tribal corpor rather than their own pocket somewhat annoy the feder govern semi-regular grant valuabl asset to these tribe when they'v burn through the one previous given where feasibl typic sell the asset to american or foreign compani and the cycl continu so what is the primari problem for the tribe that have problem in a nutshel a thorough patholog cultur and societi few women reach the age of number without get pregnant incest rape and gross promiscu is rampant inbreed heavi drug abus dure pregnanc and other environment factor have creat tribe where a veri substanti fraction of the tribe is liter mental retard mani of the thought and intellig tribe member leav the reserv at the earliest opportun most to avoid the problem mention abov on one reserv my parent live the hiv infect rate was percent mani of these societi are thorough corrupt and the administr of the law is arbitrari and caprici (they do have their own judg court polic etc) in short mani of these tribe that are still hang togeth are in a shambl becaus they have becom the most patholog societi that i have ever seen anywher becaus of their legal status there realli aren't that mani consequ for their behavior there are mani thing that i could tell you that i'v seen that you probabl would not believ unless you'd seen it yourself there are alway good peopl in these tribe but it has gotten to the point where the loser and idiot outnumb the good guy by a fair margin mani time and this is a mobocraci typic (btw if ani of you white folk want to experi overt and aggress racism as a minor in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the polic are open thug tri live on one of these mess up indian reserv it will give you an interest perspect on things.) there are onli two real situat where you find reason prosper indian the first is in the rare case of tribe run by disciplin and intellig peopl that have manag their asset wise the second is where the tribe has dispers and assimil for the most part even if they maintain their tribal ident in both of these case the tribal leader reject the insular behavior that tend to lead to the patholog case mention abov the indian are often quit wealthi technic and a lot of money is spent by the tribe per capita and the actual report incom is quit high when you consid how mani are live entir off the tribal dole it is just that their peculiar econom structur doe not lend itself well to ordinari econom analysi by mere look at their nomin incom the poverti is social and cultur in natur not econom this was my origin point on a tangent one thing that has alway interest me is the concept of quasi-trib corpor social mani indian tribe implement a type of corpor social that is mind-boggl bad in execut that they use this structur at all is an accid of histori more than anyth but what has interest me is that the veri smart manag one do surpris well over the long run it is like a famili corpor writ larg it seem that in a futur where "familial" tie will be increas voluntari the general concept may have some merit in general western societi serv to creat a facsimil of a biolog extend famili with the includ dynam but with an arbitrari set of self-select individu damn that was long (and it late) and it could have been a lot longer -jame roger email on
