 this is not direct spamassassin relat but more of a general dealing-with-spam issu what is the best way to deal with spam dure the smtp transact there are domain and address that i know are spam at the mail from and can deal with at the smtp level i have been and i think most peopl respond with a number code a "permanent" error that pretti much mean "don't bother to tri from that address again you'll get the same error." peopl often add cathart messag to accompani the number like "spammer must die." but this might not be the best way to go you are tell the spammer that you are on to them this may caus them to tri other method to get around your block is it perhap better to blackhol the mail that is act like everyth is ok dure the smtp transact but then just drop the mail into the bitbucket (this is general how spamassassin work sinc almost everyon use it after the smtp transact has complet successfully.) spammer think everyth is go fine and has no reason to tri new method then there is a third possibl instead of return a number code indic you'r on to the spammer fake a number respons which is say "mailbox doe not exist." this would be in the hope that some spammer out there actual remov name report as non-exist from their list i know a slim hope but even if onli a few do it can lower the incid so what are the argument for each do spammer even look at _any_ of the bounc messag they get the volum of bounc must be huge person i'm start to think blackhol are the way to go.. but send back that "spammer die die die," or stock "access dee-nied!" (mi ephasi added) messag can be pretti satisfi ;) -- crist j clark  email  email URL  email ------------------------------------------------------- in remembr number _______________________________________________ spamassassin-talk mail list email URL
