instead you  simpli revert to base state on reboot  in that case you can use someth consider less power than  all you need is a machin configur to boot from cd-rom and use  ram disk for scratch space numer linux distro are avail that  you boot a stateless but function system from cd-rom but ram is expens and the directori structur of mani system (e.g windows) are not suffici organ and standard to make this combin of bootabl cds and ram drive practic even if you are fortun enough to be use linux (or anoth fhs-compliant *nix) you still can't fit a lot on a cd it not unusu today to have gigabyt of static multimedia content on the web server this particular problem can be allevi somewhat by use dvds but this is a temporari solut at best which will becom outdat quick as our data requir grow and hard drive becom cheaper  obvious you can't do this with partit that accru import  state e.g a partit that store databas tabl data  but if you *do* want some state to persist then you need a  writabl partit to protect it you need some kind of  control manag to decid who can do what to the writabl  blah blah blah .. and befor you know it the secur  start to look just like it doe for convent server right this is whi you would consolid all state of ani long-term signific on just a coupl partit and whi you would not put static applic code on these changeabl partit fortun most larg client/serv applic physic architectur do this anyhow becaus these are two fundament differ kind of state with two veri differ set of administr secur raid and backup requir peopl also tend to do this anyhow becaus layer logic architectur are popular with the gui at one end busi logic in the middl and persist servic at the other this logic architectur map natur to a physic architectur that has a static web server a static applic server and a databas server that has static and changeabl partit (i use the word static versus changeabl instead of writeabl versus unwrit becaus the "unchangeable" partit might be written to for temporari swap space who know what window doe internally?) my point is that there should be a market out there for a hardwar raid devic that can split design partit into a perman base imag partit and a temporari delta imag partit that has some simpl but solid secur measur to prevent the unauthor remot modif of base imag and that can be configur to clear the delta imag when the server is reboot if some vendor wish to implement this they could then market this as a mechan to help frustrat broad class of attack that reli on the perman modif of system or applic file via buffer overflow platform and middlewar bug etc the prevent of unauthor modif of applic data of cours would not be address by this particular product but there are mani other techniqu out there to defend applic data but those techniqu all assum that your system itself has not been compromis at a lower level which is where this product could help i would have to think that these featur would be relat easi for a hardwar raid vendor to implement (i'm just guess of cours with no knowledg of how hardwar raid work internally.) if anyon know of such a product i'd love to hear about it ben
