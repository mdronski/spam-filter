 on wed oct number number at number number matthia saou wrote   so i'v attach a patch to specifi an altern kernel by set the   "target_kernel" environ variabl befor run rpmbuild you   still need to have the rpm for the specifi kernel instal but at   least it doesn't have to be current run it kinda hackish so   if someon has a better way to do this let me know   that idea look good although it mayb need to be tweak a bit more (what  you sent doesn't support packag name "kernel-smp") i'd also prefer a  cleaner way than the env variabl and preferr not edit the spec..  probabl "--defin target number --with smp" sound good enough  the buildrequir on "kernel-source" will also need to be remov becaus  it won't necessarili need to be true and that doe bug me a bit :-/ the "--define" is exact what i was look for i was tri to figur out a way to do it within the mechan of rpm (like the "--with" switches) but for some reason didn't think of use "--define" my comput is current gone for repair but onc it back i'll rewrit the specfil add support for kernel-smp and email it to the list for further critic :) as far as requir kernel-sourc i don't feel it a big problem if you'r gonna go to the troubl of packag custom kernel into rpms it not a far stretch to packag the sourc tree too (as i current do) also i'v found that the alsa-driv sourc need a usb-rel patch to compil under the latest test kernel number are other peopl see the same thing or is this just a problem with my setup gari p.s if i didn't mention it befor thank for the alsa packag they great simplifi what use to take way too long befor _______________________________________________ rpm-list mail list email URL
