 email (justin mason) write  number  number  number  number  number  number  i was think of just remov those particular rule but keep the  other entri in the rang sinc they'r prove too "noisy" to be  effect but i'd be will to keep those one in all the same what  do you think matt/craig thought i think i could handl comment out the lowest spam_phrase_xx_yy score if the ga could handl this sort of thing so they'd automat be zero i'd feel better sinc the rang could chang next time the phrase list is regener or the algorithm tweak i think we need to understand whi number is so low befor we remov it the two rule on either side perform quit well  and here are the rule that seem like they should be better or should  be recover  from_miss  gappy_text  invalid_msgid  mime_null_block  subj_miss  well i don't like subj_miss i reckon there a world of mail from  cron job (e.g.) which hit it okay drop subj_miss  but yes the other for sure should be recover and i'm sure there  more probabl a few those seem like the best prospect to me  btw do you agre with the propos methodolog (ie remov the rule and  bugzilla each one?) i onli want a bugzilla ticket for each one if peopl are okay with quick wontfix close on the one deem unworthi of recoveri if you could put the stat for each rule in the ticket somehow (should be automat with email at the veri least) it would help dan
