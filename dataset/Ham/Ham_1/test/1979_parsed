open this friday   michael   whi is it that peopl who consid vote in an elect an  inconveni would go to see a movi to show support for it messag  don't get me wrong -- i think this is the case peopl will go to  see your movi as much to be entertain and inform as they will to  express their malic and discont toward not onli the present  regim in america but also the corrupt empti shallow pantomim  which cast them into power   in realiti today the vote that take place via the act of  consumpt far outweigh the impact caus by peopl go to a booth  and dimpl the appropri chad or some other such convolut act  of free democrat express   whi becaus in america they believ in dollar dollar don't lie  in practis they are the last frontier of truth in america  univers accept as express of fear desir passion and  need compar to the swing of the almighti buck and jeb bush know  this a hang chad has onli the nethermost mean   given that fact i modest propos an entir new though wholli  logic extens to the current democrat system in place in  america   i propos we augment and effect replac the elector system  with a polit stock market we should accept that politician are  entrepreneur just like ani other businessperson in america and  embrac this fact in build an econom system which truli reflect  their intent a politician should issu a constant number of share  depend upon his tenur in govern those share should be  trade on an open exchang say the g.r.e.e.d (short of cours for  the "global realist elector exchang -- democratic") politician  we believ in will see their stock rise higher as faith in their  abil to maintain offic grow as the truth about their embezzl  campaign fund for weekend trip to maui with their intern is  reveal of cours their fortun will fall   this repres an opportun for the market forc -- those same  forc which you intend to har to express your own person  protest -- to voic their opinion on the qualiti of america  govern dure the interven four year between elect  elect themselv will in effect becom meaningless as they are  now sinc their outcom will be influenc by the stock price of each  and everi congressman senat and presidenti candid   just think of the coverag that could be given on msnbc "strom  thurman (strom news - quotes) was down percent today on fear that his  latest heart oper will render him unabl to attend senat arm  servic committe meet until november.." this would provid  rejuven content to the econo-polit news sector which has  found post-economic-bubbl coverag to be both tiresom and  deoress the establish of this new stock exchang would of  cours creat job for newli unemploy (and government retrained)  it system engin who could after pass the elector secur  exam becom floor trader   this would also allow for a conveni and veri public method by which  candid could rais capit in the public market to support their  multi-billion-dollar campaign the requir for the support of  legion of spin doctor perman campaign manag and investor  relat personnel would also creat job -- perhap even a new  practic for ernst & young arthur anderson et al insid trade  scandal and mislead revenu declar would of cours catch  martha stewart as an unwit beneficiari thus spread her  influenc to polit   dividend if there are ani on record at the close of a politician  career could be paid to current sharehold base on the hold  pension fund could provid the institut invest support  necessari to underpin even the biggest dog among the beltway set  union fund brokerag and even pump-and-dump hous could benefit  from meteor rise in conserv candid run in the  southeast and the bush governmet would be allow to place social  secur bet where they realli matter investor who lose their  retir life save and support could rest assur that they  were inde rob by crook rather than poor investor   although there no way to protect ani of these for worldcom-lik  crash ambiti inspir district attorney could file crimin  suit against candid and campaign manag who underperform  expect thus assur investor that their logic was not faulti  -- instead they were mere defraud by crook and thiev   on the whole i believ the system could work i could certain work  as well as our belov secur trade industri and given the  american elector system success at effect express the will  of the peopl it certain couldn't do ani worse..
