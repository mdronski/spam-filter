the  "creator" lose control.. if i buy a chair you built and then  decid to give it away to my neighbor by you'r definit he  just stole from you i don't endors the whole riaa thing but to be accur you would have to duplic the chair so that both you and your neighbour could continu to sit down and yes i suppos that would be more serious they can sit on /your/ copi but if you start churn out exact dup of a name-brand artifact peopl with law degre start to smell money for exampl i could copi a gibson guitar /exactly/ so long as (a) i don't put orvill name on the headstock and (b) i licens the patent brace method if i instead tri to sell a homebuilt guitar on ebay with "gibson" written in crayon on the headstock and then claim it is a true les paul limit edit i expect peopl would get upset  whi is it that peopl don't understand that give stuff away  is a perfect accept tactic in capitalist busi to play the devil advoc here it not about give /stuff/ away it is about grant endless and cascad duplication/distribut right even if _i_ onli make the copi i give to you that doesn't stop you from make number copi to sell  access to free stuff often help to sell other stuff this is the difficult question how will they draw the distinct the "other stuff" is just as easi to duplic as the free stuff this is whi ms is hunt peopl with illeg window it no harder to dup than a linux cd onli what is there that actual prevent peopl from do it person i don't think the issu should have anyth to do with sale or unit the issu is that basic phallaci that say a suit should be abl to "own" someon els intellectu properti sarah mclaughlin isn't su you it her label legal dept becaus it the label who stand to lose sarah alreadi fat beyond her wildest dream so a few buck here or there or even if the well dri up tomorrow it not go to realli traumat her (unless she been blaze stupid with her money) but the label .. like disney and mickey they need the cash cow so they can keep all sort of uncreat hangers-on in limo and coke if you thought onli elvi or brian jone or denni wilson had problem with beautiful-peopl deadbeat leech "friends" drain their rich think again the problem is realli veri simpl becaus it is semant and until we make the semant flip it unsolv but like trisect an angl all it take is look at the same situat in a differ way here the revel elvi never ever made a hit record elvi didn't make the hit his /fans/ made the hit his fan did the work clean toilet man the conveni store drive milk truck sit at endless offic desk they did the /real/ labour that paid for everi last one of elvi presley pill all elvi did was sing into a microphon everi so often and pen or collect the odd song that all those /people/ like and want as someth of their own but it not _elvis_ who made them univers statement it is the univers of fan who slurp the song into their own live it was pull-technolog not push therefor the question becom how mani time must these fan pay befor they own what they themselv have creat they pay royalti for listen to the radio for blank tape for concert ticket for a beer in a bar with a cover band .. they pay over and over and over again for the /right/ to make some hack writer song /their/ favourit song??? that where the whole system has been serious warp by the record compani and ad compani refram it into your think that it is the elvi who make the elvi it not it the peopl who make them the song are alreadi their -- gari lawrenc murphi email teledynam communic inc busi advantag through communiti softwar  URL "comput are useless
