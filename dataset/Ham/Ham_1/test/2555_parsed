 onc upon a time ben wrote   i use a most red hat number system but prefer to configur and build my  kernel by hand i'd like to humbl offer a tweak to alsa-driver.spec  that help it build clean under such circumst i recogn that  freshrpms.net packag are design with standard red hat in mind  includ a standard kernel rpm howev i hope that matthia will  consid the tweak small enough to justifi it incorpor well i don't realli find it consist at all to use an rpm packag built against someth that wasn't instal through rpm :-/ what i'd recommend in your case  you should keep at least one origin red hat linux kernel (you do just in case right ;-)) and instal the match alsa-kernel packag as you'll need at least one becaus of the depend then for your custom built kernel simpli "./configur --with-cards=al && make && make instal destdir=/tmp/alsa-driver" from the alsa-driv sourc then as root copi all the modul under /tmp/alsa-driver/lib/modules/ to your modul dir and run "depmod -a" of cours you can even make it much faster by not compil all un-need driver as i guess that one of the reason one would rebuild his own kernel i find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem it what i'v done and what i'll keep do on my laptop where i'm run a kernel recompil with acpi matthia -- clean custom red hat linux rpm packag  URL red hat linux releas number (valhalla) run linux kernel number load  number number number _______________________________________________ rpm-list mail list email URL
