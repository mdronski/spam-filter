URL integr into solari yeah yeah yeah i tri it (over a year ago) and it suck like a new vacuum cleaner although i expect that it will be a lot better by now what i would realli like to see is gnome on one of the sun ray thin termin  out of curios doe `normal fashion` mean that you still have to do the  interact customis or is it like solari jumpstart where you can  specifi everyth on the instal server do `boot net - install` go home and  come in to a fulli instal and patch desktop the next morn er i mean normal fashion for a linux instal this would be distro specif anyway i am sure it would be possibl to do an autom instal with a few script chang i would not be surpris if debian doe this alreadi i do know that if you pass extra paramet on the boot command they are pick up by silo so boot disk linux would not prompt for select but would boot straight through from there it is a matter of tftp'ing the correct config file and the instal would be automat from there on  i don't see whi this should be a _major problem the prom (ie the "ok"  prompt)  is almost at the hardwar level and henc dosent depend on the os so you  should be abl to connect to that easili enough onc the machin is instal  cant you just log in over the network the network is the comput after all  (sorri couldn't resist!) the problem is that the time between linux boot and when the consol tti driver are start can be a black hole without error messag or log in prompt the other problem is that sometim linux will drop in to the prom on shutdown instead of power off or reboot without a serial cabl or keyboard it is not possibl to reboot the box without flick the power switch hidden at the back of the case i think if the consol is number it will drop into prom if it is /dev/nul then you do not get consol messag but the box will shut down proper - matthew __________________________________________________ do you yahoo! everyth you'll ever need on one web page from news and sport to email and music chart URL -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
