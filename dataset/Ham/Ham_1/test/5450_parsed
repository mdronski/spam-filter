 on wednesday number septemb number number cet justin mason wrote  malt s stretz said    i think we should even add new (ga'd) rule to number (and/or remov old   ones) and tag a new number onli if we have a bunch of featur worth a   "dangerous" big updat i'd say yes you should expect number and also   number (but updat to number now)   i would think ad new rule to or remov broken rule from number  would requir some discuss first but new ga'd score are definit  worth put in as the one there are too wild i think my mail wasn't veri clear ;-) my point was that we should continu releas new rule and remov broken one (all base on discuss on this list of course) in the number branch instead of creat a new number branch everytim we have a bunch of new rule a new branch should be openend onli if (big) new featur are introduc (eg bayes) or the interfac has chang (spam_level_char=x) as the rule are under fluent develop the user has to updat quit regular but current he couldn't be shure if the new releas will break anyth in his setup (like -f go away) so if we say "the branch are stabl to the outsid and just improv under the surfac but you have to watch out when you updat to a new minor version number" user and sysadmin could be less reluct to updat all just imho :o) malt p.s. i'll be away from my box and my mail account for one week start tomorrow so happi code for the next week :-) -- --- code is art --
