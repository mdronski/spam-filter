eleg number the valu of analog program languag design is a compar new activ - it has exist for less than half a centuri so it is often worthwhil to look to older design disciplin to understand better this new activ thus my book principl of program languag design evalu and implement grew out of a studi of teach method in architectur primarili but also of pedagogi in other disciplin such as aircraft design perhap you have also seen analog drawn between program languag and car (fortran = model t c = dune buggi etc.) these analog can be veri inform and can serv as ``intuit pumps' to enhanc our creativ but they cannot be use uncrit becaus they are in the end just analog ultim our design decis must be base on more than analog sinc analog can be mislead as well as inform in this essay i'll address the role of aesthet in program languag design but i will base my remark on a book about structur engin the tower and the bridg by david p billington although there are mani differ between bridg and program languag we will find that mani idea and insight transfer rather direct accord to billington there are three valu common to mani technolog activ which we can call ``the three e's' effici economi and eleg these valu correspond to three dimens of technolog which billington call the scientif social and symbol dimens (the three s's) we will consid each in turn effici seek to minim resourc use in structur engin effici deal with the amount of materi use the basic criterion is safeti and the issu are scientif (strength of materi disposit of forc etc.) similar in program languag design effici is a scientif question deal with the use of resourc there are mani exampl where effici consider influenc program languag design (some are review in my principl of program languages) in the earli day the resourc to be minim were often runtim memori usag and process time although compile-tim resourc util was also relev in other case the resourc econom was programm type time and there are well-known case in which this compromis safeti (e.g fortran implicit declarations) there are also mani well-known case in which secur (i.e safety) was sacrif for the sake of effici by neglect runtim error check (e.g array bound checking) effici issu often can be quantifi in term of comput memori or time but we must be care that we are not compar appl and orang compil time is not interchang run time and neither one is the same as programm time similar comput memori cannot be trade off against comput time unless both are reduc to a common denomin such as money but this bring in econom consider to which we now turn economi seek to maxim benefit versus cost wherea effici is a scientif issu economi is a social issu in structur engin economi seek to maxim social benefit compar to it cost (this is especi appropri sinc structur like bridg are usual built at public expens for the benefit of the public.) in program languag design the ``public' that must be satisfi is the program communiti that will use the languag and the institut for which these programm work econom tradeoff are hard to make becaus econom valu chang and are difficult to predict for exampl the shift from first to second generat program languag was larg a result of a decreas in the cost of comput time compar to programm time the shift from the second to the third generat involv the increas cost of residu bug in program and the fourth generat reflect the increas cost of program mainten compar to program develop other social factor involv in the success or failur of a program languag includ whether major manufactur support the languag whether prestigi univers teach it whether it is approv in some way by influenti organ (such as the us depart of defense) whether it has been standard whether it come to be perceiv as a ``real' languag (use by ``real programmers'') or as a ``toy' languag (use by novic or dilettantes) and so forth as can be seen from the histor remark in my principl social factor are frequent more import than scientif factor in determin the success or failur of a program languag often econom issu can be quantifi in term of money but the monetari valu of cost and benefit are often unstabl and unpredict becaus they depend on chang market forc also mani social issu from dissatisfact with poor design softwar to human miseri result from system failur are inaccur repres by the singl dimens of monetari cost all kind of ``cost' and ``benefit' must be consid in seek an econom design eleg symbol good design ``eleg who care about elegance?' snort the hard-nos engin but billington show clear the critic role of eleg in ``hard-nosed' engin for the design it is well-known that featur interact pose a serious problem for languag design becaus of the difficulti of analyz all the possibl interact of featur in a languag (see my principl for examples) structur engin face similar problem of analyt complex but billington observ that the best design don't make extens use of comput model and calcul one reason is that mathemat analysi is alway incomplet the engin must make a decis about which variabl are signific and which are not and an analysi may lead to incorrect conclus if this decis is not made well also equat are often simplifi (e.g. made linear) to make their analysi feasibl and this is anoth potenti sourc of error becaus of these limit engin that depend on mathemat analysi may overdesign a structur to compens for unforeseen effect left out of the analysi thus the price of safeti is addit materi and increas cost (i.e decreas effici and economy) similar in program languag design the limit of the analyt approach often forc us to make a choic between an under-engin design in which we run the risk of unanticip interact and an over-engin design in which we have confid but which is ineffici or uneconom mani peopl have seen the famous film of the collaps in number of the four-month-old tacoma narrow bridg it vibrat itself to piec in a storm becaus aerodynam stabil had not been consid in it design billington explain that this accid along with a number of less dramat bridg failur was a consequ of an increas use of theoret analys that began in the number howev the veri problem that destroy the tacoma narrow bridg had been anticip and avoid a centuri befor by bridg design who were guid by aesthet principl accord to billington the best structur engin do not reli on mathemat analysi (although they do not abandon it altogether) rather their design activ is guid by a sens of eleg this is becaus solut to structur engin problem are usual great underdetermin that is there are mani possibl solut to a particular problem such as bridg a particular river therefor expert design restrict their attent to design in which the interact of the forc is easi to see the design look unbalanc if the forc are unbalanc and the design look stabl if it is stabl the general principl is that design that look good will also be good and therefor the design process can be guid by aesthet without extens (but incomplete) mathemat analysi billington express this idea by invert the old architectur maxim and assert that in structur design function follow form he add (p number ``when the form is well chosen it analysi becom astound simple.' in other word the choic of form is open and free so we should pick form where eleg design express good design (i.e effici and econom design) if we do so then we can let aesthet guid design the same appli to program languag design by restrict our attent to design in which the interact of featur is manifest - in which good interact look good and bad interact look bad - we can let our aesthet sens guid our design and we can be much more confid that we have a good design without have to check all the possibl interact for the user in this case what good for the design also is good for the user nobodi is comfort cross a bridg that look like it will collaps at ani moment and nobodi is comfort use a program languag in which featur may ``explode' if combin in the wrong way the manifest balanc of forc in a well-design bridg give us confid when we cross it so also the manifest good design of our program languag should reinforc our confid when we program in it becaus we have (well-justified) confid in the consequ of our action we accomplish littl by cover an unbalanc structur in a beauti facad when the bridg is unabl to sustain the load for which it was design and collaps it won't much matter that it was beauti on the outsid so also in program languag if the eleg is onli superfici that is if it is not the manifest of a deep coher in the design then programm will quick see through the illus and loos their (unwarranted) confid in summari good design choos to work in a region of the design space where good design look good as a consequ these design can reli on their aesthet sens as can the user of the structur (bridg or program languages) they design we may miss out on some good design this way but they are of limit valu unless both the design and the user can be confid that they are good design we may summar the preced discuss in a maxim analog to those in my principl of program languag the eleg principl confin your attent to design that look good becaus they are good the program languag as work environ there are other reason that eleg is relev to a well-engin program languag the program languag is someth the profession programm will live with - even live in it should feel comfort and safe like a well-design home or offic in this way it can contribut to the qualiti of the activ that take place within it would you work better in an orient garden or a sweatshop a program languag should be a joy to use this will encourag it use and decreas the programm fatigu and frustrat the program languag should not be a hindranc but should serv more as a collabor encourag programm to do their job better as some automobil are ``drive machines' and work as a natur extens of the driver so a program languag should be a ``program machine' by encourag the programm to acquir the smooth compet and seem effortless skill of a virtuoso the program languag should invit the programm to design eleg effici and econom program through it aesthet dimens a program languag symbol mani valu for exampl in the varieti of it featur it may symbol proflig excess spare economi or ascetic the kind of it featur may repres intellectu sophist down-to-earth practic or ignor crude thus a program languag can promot a set of valu by embodi certain valu it encourag us to think about them by neglect or negat other valu it allow them to reced into the background and out of our attent out of sight out of mind acquir a sens of eleg aesthet is notori difficult to teach so you may wonder how you are suppos to acquir that refin sens of eleg necessari to good design billington observ that this sens is acquir through extens experi in design which especi in europ is encourag by a competit process for choos bridg design becaus of it structur engin design mani more bridg than they build and they learn from each competit they loos by compar their own design with those of the winner and other loser the public also critiqu the compet design and in this way becom more educ their sens of eleg develop along with that of the design so also to improv as a program languag design you should design mani languag - design obsess - and critic revis and discard your design you should also evalu and critic other peopl design and tri to improv them in this way you will acquir the bodi of experi you will need when the ``real thing' come along refer number david p. the tower and the bridg the new art of structur engin princeton princeton univers press number chapter number and
