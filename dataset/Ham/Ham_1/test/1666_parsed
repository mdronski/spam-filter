 date tue number aug number number number from email message-id email  ever tri to get mh to *not* have a pseq sequenc hmm - i'v been use mh for a long time (sinc well befor there were sequences) and i don't think i'v ever seen a "pseq" .. i'm guess that that the sequenc that you have "pick" creat as i recal it it has no default sequenc name so the sequenc name that peopl use will tend to vari from person to person won't they (except as mh configur move around institut by osmosis) i'v alway use "sel" for that purpos i kind of doubt that ani pre built-in sequenc name is go to be veri general even "unseen" can be chang (fortun that one is easi to find in the mh profil - though whether exmh doe that os just use "unseen" i haven't bother to find out) kre _______________________________________________ exmh-work mail list email URL
