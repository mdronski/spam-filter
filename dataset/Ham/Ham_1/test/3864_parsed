but we must toler him rod liddl wednesday august number number the guardian sheikh abu hamza al-masri our maddest of mad mullah and a cartoon bogeyman to scare the kiddi spent a quiet and contempl bank holiday play with his own children in victoria park hackney i'v often wonder what incendiari islam fundamentalist cleric do on statutori public holiday head for the beach and mayb swing by b&q on the way home i had hope i had this beguil vision of hamza paddl in the sea an ice-cream cone in his one good hand the wave tickl his shin and the sheikh mental prepar to fix those peski shelv in the kitchen for onc instead of plan the extermin of zionism and america and mayb me and you too but b&q and a day at the seasid is probabl beyond hamza budget sinc the bank of england froze his asset so victoria park had to do but he sound happi enough when i spoke to him with the babbl of tini cheer islam proto-warrior in the background you must know hamza he the imam design it would seem by the daili mail cartoonist mac larg metal hook in place of a left hand one eye cover by a patch the other a bale watch milky-whit we don't mock the disabl ani more these day unless it someon like hamza whom we don't like then if you'll excus the inapt phraseolog the glove come off so hamza is known (with that vault imagin typic of the british right) as "captain hook" in articl which usual call for his arrest or extradit to the us or deport back home to egypt or mayb off to pakistan or afghanistan where he fought the russian for year and thus sustain his disabl - anywher realli just out of here and if we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the countri mayb we can forc him to shut up becaus we don't like hamza veri much we weren't that fond of him befor septemb number but afterward in that nervi paranoid few month when we all thought the sky might fall in our disapprob turn into polit persecut and now the daili mirror is agit again for his arrest becaus they'v got hold of secret video of the man behav in an even more inflammatori manner urg warfar on and loot of enemi of islam all out of context and a veri long time ago say the imam not unduli bother but perhap he should be becaus our reput for broad-minded and toler toward peopl like hamza was thin even befor the mirror scoop hamza preach or preach at the scari finsburi park mosqu - so earlier this year the chariti commission ban him from do so becaus of his alleg inflammatori remark i didn't know chariti commission were meant to do stuff like that he has had his passport seiz and not return his asset have been frozen he is tail by the polic everi now and then and his access to the media is restrict by intern polic within broadcast corpor and the press and this last point is becaus we tell ourselv endless - repeat the mantra over and over again and fervent wish it to be true - hamza is not "representative" of british muslim as if british muslim were a simpl homogen thing with a singl voic that one could turn to everi now and then for explan and perhap succour the troubl is in the first month or so after the twin tower attack he was reveal to be rather more "representative" than the list of those government-approv muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfort i suspect - dragoon briefli into statement of support for the war against terror and a blanket condemn of the taliban an opinion poll commiss by radio number today programm reveal that an overwhelm major of british muslim were against georg bush crusad one in six were to put it mild ambival about the attack on the us (the remaind condemn the attack unequivocally) a larg major thought the war against terror was a war against islam which is what hamza said repeat but it was someth that at the time we didn't want to hear now if you quiz the man on present polici at home and abroad he come across - superfici at least - as someon from the liber left no war against iraq britain to becom independ of us foreign polici and attempt rapproch with arab state stronger action against israel mistrust of global capit redistribut of wealth nor is he particular anti-semit so far as i can tell although i don't suppos he will be holiday in eilat this year in yesterday guardian the chief rabbi express a willing to talk to hamza and was grate for the sheikh messag of condol when a london synagogu was attack which is not to say that hamza is a peaceabl jeffersonian democrat who has been wil misrepres he is without question rather more inflammatori in privat sermon to his own peopl than he is in public his ideolog is an arid and uncompromis interpret of islam he would be happi in a truli islam societi to stone women to death for adulteri for exampl you and i would find mani - perhap most - of his view utter repel and that the point becaus hamza is the true test of our appar desir to be multicultur multicultur is not sure the cheer appropri of bit of inoffens minor cultur behaviour by the rule hegemoni that is a sort of syncop monocultur multicultur is rather the abil of societi to toler view that are antithet to the domin cultur - and mayb learn from them the fbi has been investig hamza but of cours has found noth remot incrimin the real reason for his vilif and persecut is simpli the pungenc of his view it is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him becaus his rhetor increas hostil against the muslim popul general this is a perfect nobl argument but it doe not wash you don't defus a difficult situat by pretend it doesn't exist and if british muslim - mayb a minor mayb not - feel a grow sens of uneas or mystif at the direct of western foreign polici it is not becaus they have been led in that direct by hamza shut the man up therefor won't make a differ it is rather as loui macneic had it the glass is fall hour by hour the glass will fall for ever but if you break the bloodi glass you won't hold up the weather ------------------------ yahoo group sponsor  number dvds free +s&p join now number  to unsubscrib from this group send an email to email your use of yahoo group is subject to URL
