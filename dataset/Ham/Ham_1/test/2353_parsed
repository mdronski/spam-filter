 on august number an entiti known as "idefense" sent out an announc which is append to this email briefli "idefense" which bill itself as "a global secur intellig company" is offer cash for inform about secur vulner in comput softwar that are not public known especi if you promis not to tell anyon els if this kind of secret traffic is allow to continu it will pose a veri serious threat to our comput communic infrastructur at the moment the domin paradigm for comput secur research known as "full disclosure" peopl who discov secur vulner in softwar tell the vendor about them and a short while later --- after the vendor has had a chanc to fix the problem --- they publish the inform includ code to exploit the vulner if possibl this method has proven far superior to the old paradigm establish by cert in the late number which it propon might call "respons disclosure" --- never releas work exploit code and never releas ani inform on the vulner befor all vendor have releas a patch this procedur often left hundr of thousand of comput vulner to known bug for month or year while the vendor work on featur and often even after the patch were releas peopl wouldn't appli them becaus they didn't know how serious the problem was the underground comput crimin communiti would often discov and exploit these same hole for month or year while the "respons disclosure" process kept their victim who had no connect in the underground vulner the problem with this is that vulner that are wide known are much less danger becaus their victim can take step to reduc their potenti impact --- includ disabl softwar turn off vulner featur filter traffic in transit and detect and respond to intrus they are therefor much less use to would-b intrud also softwar compani usual see secur vulner in their softwar as pr problem and so prefer to delay public (and the expens of fix the bugs) as long as possibl idefens is offer a new altern that appear far more danger than either of the two previous paradigm they want to be a buyer in a marketplac for secret softwar vulner inform reward discover of vulner with cash not long befor snosoft a group of secur research evid includ some crimin element appar made an offer to sell the secreci of some softwar vulner inform to the softwar vendor specif they appar made a privat offer to hewlett-packard to keep a vulner in hp number unix secret if hp retain snosoft "consult services" hp consid this extort and respond with legal threat and snosoft publish the inform if this is allow to happen it will caus two problem which togeth add up to a catastroph first secret softwar vulner inform will be avail to the highest bidder and to nobodi els for reason explain later i think the highest bidder will general be organ crime syndic although that will not be obvious to the seller second find softwar vulner and keep them secret will becom lucrat for mani more talent peopl the result will be --- just as in the "respons disclosure" day --- that the good guy will remain vulner for month and year while the major of current vulner are kept secret i'v heard it argu that the highest bidder will general be the vendor of the vulner softwar but i don't think that plausibl if someon can steal number number becaus a softwar bug let them the softwar vendor is never held liabl often in fact the peopl who administ the softwar aren't liabl either --- when credit card data are stolen from an e-commerc site for exampl know about a vulner befor anyon els might save a web-sit administr some time and it might save the softwar vendor some negat pr but it can net the thief thousand of dollar i think the highest bidder will be those for whom earli vulner inform is most lucrat --- the thiev who can use it to execut the largest heist without get caught inevit that mean organ crime syndic although the particular gang who are good at network theft may not yet exist there might be the occasion case where a market leader such as microsoft could make more money by give their competitor bad pr than a gang could make by theft think of a remote-root hole in samba for exampl right now peopl who know how to find secur exploit are either motiv by person interest in the subject motiv by the public interest motiv by a desir for individu recognit or person know crimin that benefit from their exploit creat a marketplac in secret vulner inform would vast increas the avail of that inform to the peopl who can afford to pay the most for it spi terrorist and organ crime let not let that happen this is the origin idefens announc from sunil jame
