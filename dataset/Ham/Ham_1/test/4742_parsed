over the past number years)  recent high-resolut studi of histor number concentr and  temperatur over hundr of thousand of year have shown a modest  correl between the two in a number of case number level increas  are not in phase with temperatur increas and actual trail the  increas in temperatur by a short time i.e increas in temperatur  preced increas in number concentr the more studi that are done  of the geolog record the more it seem that number concentr are  correl with temperatur increas but are not signific  causat base on the vostok data you are right there is a veri strong correl between temperatur and number concentr but it doesn't alway appear to be causal  with respect to absolut number concentr it is also import to  point out that our best data to date suggest that they follow a fair  regular cycl with a period of about number year also correct -- the peak of each cycl is at about number ppm number  as it  happen current number concentr are within percent of other previous  cyclic concentr peak for which we have good data not correct mauna loa data number and number show that the current number concentr are at number percent *greater* than the *highest* record valu from the past number year furthermor number concentr are grow at number everi number year much faster than ani record increas in the vostok data (though perhap the vostok data isn't capabl of such fine resolution)  in other word we may be ad to the number level no we are *definitely* ad to number level look at the follow chart number (show number concentr sinc number the "histor record") not onli is the number increas over number year unpreced in the vostok record it is clear that the rate of chang is *increasing* not decreas there is no other compel explan for this increas except for anthropogen input you'r realli out on the fring if you'r debat this -- even global warm skeptic general conced this point  but it look a lot like we  would be build a molehil on top of a mountain in the histor  record at the veri least there is noth anomal about current number  concentr wrong again current number level are current unpreced over the past number year unless there is some mechan that allow number level to quick spike and then return back to "normal" background level (and henc the spike might not show up in the ice cores) still by around number we will have reach number ppm number a level that even you would have a hard time argu away  also number level interact with the biospher in a manner that ultim  affect temperatur again the interact is not entir  predict but this is believ to be one of the regul negat  feedback system mention abov yes cloud and ocean are a big unknown still we know ocean water has a finit capac to store number and if the world temperatur doesn't increas but we all have seattle-lik weather all the time the effect would be enorm  last as greenhous gase go number isn't particular potent although it  make up for it in volum in some case gase such as water and  methan have a far greater impact as greenhous gase on a per molecul  basi water vapor may actual be the key greenhous gas someth  that number onli indirect effect through it interact with the  biospher correct data on relat contribut of greenhous gass number note that methan concentr now are *much* higher than pre-industri level (mani cow fart and rice paddi outgassing) and methan is also a contributor in the format of atmospher water vapor anoth clear anthropogen increas in a greenhous gas i'm in favor of reduct in methan level as well data on water vapor here URL  number was an easi mark for earli environment but all the recent  studi and data i'v seen give me the impress that it is larg a  passeng on the climat ride rather than the driver i tend to think that holist and techic approach would work best in reduc global warm i favor an energi polici that has a mix of solar wind and nuclear with all carbon-bas combust use renew sourc of c-h bond aggress pursuit of carbon sink strategi also make sens (buri tree deep underground for example) approach that involv reduct in lifestyl to a "sustainable" level are unrealist -- american just won't do it (you'd be surpris at the number of climat chang research drive suvs) but as california show dure last year energi crisi shift in pattern of consumpt are possibl and improv effici is an easi sell - jim
