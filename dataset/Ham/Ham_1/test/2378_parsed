  how easi would it be to code a menu item that mark as read all messag  befor the current messag i often have problem read heavy-traff  mail list in exmh becaus i want to read onli a subset of a list  messag but i lose track of where i was in the particular folder   this could also be code more general in the new sequenc code as a way to  remov all messag befor current from a particular sequenc easi first you'll have to excus me as i'm still use number (*) so this may not play well with recent chang (i did look at number too) and i just did this off the top of my head (i want to see if it (**) still worked) so this is somewhat untest ad a menu entri is trivial add this to your ~/.exmh/exmh-default *fops.more.m.uentrylist ketchup *fops.more.m.l_ketchup catch-up all number cur *fops.more.m.c_ketchup number then you just need to provid the sourc for number and arrang for exmh to includ it (put it in your ~/.tk/exmh directori in your user.tcl or in pick.patch if you enabl the "sourc hook" under  support) it go to look someth like this proc number {} { global exmh pick msg exmh_status "clear unseen up to cur..." red mh_setcur dollar dollar set pick(ids) [...get messag id for "pick number busi pickmarkseen exmh_status ok blue } (that base upon the gut of pick_markseen) you need to fill in the code for the [...get...] section i ran out of time john (*) "it just works" (tm) (**) "it" == my head _______________________________________________ exmh-work mail list email URL
