 john let me guess you haven't tri the boot paramet number if you are use lilo? //anders// on mon number at number john p looney wrote  i'm get place   turn out that you can't have your /boot filesystem number and the  /boot/vmlinux.gz file has to be a gzip vmlinux file (not a vmlinuz one  which though obvious...isn't when you'v been hit your head off a  wall for a few days)   also when you mkfs a filesystem that call "/boot" as far as the  redhat /etc/fstab is concern it wipe that so when you boot a rescu  cd it doesn't mount number as /boot and doesn't inform you of this   (so it dead easi to work away on /mnt/sysimage/boot think you are  work on number and wonder whi no matter what you do noth  changes)   aaaaanyway i have it boot the redhat kernel but the kernel isn't  load root as number - it keep mount number   curious when i go into the boot prom an use   "set_params" i can tell it to mount number as root but then it use  the prom copi of the kernel (dodgi number kernel) which doesn't know  number so want to fsck up my disk   rdev on the vmlinux file befor gzip doesn't work i assum you  can't run rdev on the gzip version ani other idea on how to tell a  kernel where it root fs is    kate    --  irish linux user group email  URL for (un)subscript inform  list maintain email -- best regard ander holm critic path technic support engin ======================================== tel usa/canada number number number number tel worldwid number number number number e-mail email internet URL -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
