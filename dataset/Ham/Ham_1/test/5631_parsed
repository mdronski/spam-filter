 on number sep number richard bartlett wrote richard  i have a custom who is develop some printer driver code to allow  custom driver set (n-up booklet duplex etc.) to be save up to the  server to be retriev by other user the data is be written by a  printer driver (use the log on user authent to a registri  key) hklm\system\currentcontrolset\control\print\environments\window nt  number name}\{custom key}\subkey) let me get this straight a registri key is load from the server onto the client workstat who can modifi it then write it back onto the server own registri - which is not go to use it  the question is what are the secur risk of allow user to write  to this key the data is string data in the form of delimit numer  valu this data is then retriev by capabl printer driver and  interpret   the risk as i see it are twofold  number the risk of a compromis to the server use this registri key i  think this is unlikeley as the server itself doe not use this data onli  client pc do unless someon know a way to travel out of a hive up  the registri bypass the permiss set use number what is the reason to write a registri key to a server if the server itself is not use it i don't think you should worri too much about someon travel out of the hive but again i'm curious as to how the driver actual modifi the key on the server  number the risk of a compromis to the client (far more likely) this  would probabl be by a malform or extrem long string in the key  valu which would presum lead to either dos or system compromis by  buffer overflow on the client system and if the client write the key back onto the server yes there wide open for someth nasti here two other thing spring to mind number if anyon can modifi the key how do you make sure that two user are not overwrit the same key therebi caus undesir effect number if anyon have permiss to write to the key (and below) anyon can creat thousand of extra key under this key therebi fill up the registri the result of such a thing is obvious if i got this all wrong i'd be happi that you clarifi a bit more and tell me where i might have misunderstood med venlig hilsen / best regard -allan jensen si hoc signum leger pote operi boni in rebus latinus alacribus et fructuosi potiri pote
