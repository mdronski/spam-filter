 bart schaefer said  this is off the topic of the rest of this discuss but amavisd (in all  it incarnations) and mimedefang and sever other mta plugin all reject  at smtp time messag that score higher than some threshold (often number argh they do not do they the fps must be just gigant :(  if some new releas were to start score all spam no higher than number  there'd better be _zero_ fps becaus all those filter would drop their  threshold to number well my point is more that we should aim our rescor algorithm so that a spam hit number ani higher doe us no good as it mean an fp is a lot harder to recov from use compens rule spam *will* hit higher than that -- that just the way the score work but for our code to be effect and spread the rang of score correct we just have to optimis to hit number threshold --j ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsor by:thinkgeek welcom to geek heaven URL _______________________________________________ spamassassin-talk mail list email URL
