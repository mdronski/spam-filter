 robert harley write  here are some number with the new algorithm for count point on  ellipt curv (over field of characterist number   in number reynald lercier set a record at number bit in number day of cpu  on number mhz alpha in number frederik vercauteren set a record at number  bit in number day of cpu on number mhz pcs   i'v been work on the problem sinc then these were measur just  now on rajit number mhz alpha   number bit  lift number s + number s precomput  norm number s + number s precomput   number bit  lift number s + number s precomput  norm number s + number s precomput   number bit  lift number s + number s precomput  norm number s + number s precomput   number bit  lift number h number m + number m precomput  norm number m + number h number m precomput not know one whit about ellipt curv math can you provid some expert interpret of these result it look like the old record for say number bit has been blown out of the water by a factor of number doe this mean that elipt curv encrypt is now easili breakabl or faster than befor with no loss in strength or stronger raw bit are ok cook bit are better - gordon URL
