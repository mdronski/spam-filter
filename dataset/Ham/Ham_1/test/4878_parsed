polit play field by mike mccurri and larri purpuro not mani month from now peopl across the countri will experi one of the great recur featur of american democraci at shop mall on factori floor at church social and even on our front stoop we will be approach by individu who want to repres us in public offic while chanc are high that we won't know them person they will walk up to us offer a handshak and a flier and ask for our vote just as technolog is affect everi other area of communic it has begun to affect the way polit candid communic with voter in this year gop gubernatori primari california secretari of state bill jone who face better-fund candid acquir the e-mail address of more than a million potenti california voter and sent each an unsolicit e-mail ask for support that day he might have chosen ani of the more tradit -- and more expens -- method of contact voter such as direct mail radio spot or tv ad but he spent onli about number cent per messag instead of number cent or more per messag for direct mail or in anoth medium had jone chosen direct mail radio or tv that communic would have been equal ``unsolicited,' as defin in the e-mail world few voter would have ``opt in' to receiv campaign inform from jone through ani of those channel the respons to jone e-mail effort howev was swift and intens he was lambast by anti-spam advoc and media coverag was almost entir negat to be fair some of jone tactic could have been refin he use a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practic ``paid for' disclaim in the messag his detractor howev attack him not for his tactic miscu but becaus the e-mail was sent unsolicit in fact jone onlin campaign may have been his most visibl asset in an era of cynic toward money in polit -- money typic spent on other unsolicit communic medium -- jone tri to level the play field no one like commerci spam it is irrelev and untarget and can be high intrus and even offens but as a sophist societi it time to differenti commerci spam from veri differ unsolicit e-mail sent by polit candid to voter the debat is particular relev in light of legisl in congress that would constitut the first feder law to direct address spam we believ e-mail is no more intrus than direct mail telemarket or tv advertis when it come to politician seek to reach voter a simpl link in good e-mail campaign allow recipi to opt out of futur mail direct mail take at least a phone call or stamp to be taken off a list and viewer must repeat endur tv ad when a candid lack a larg campaign war chest he or she can use the internet to provid constitu with inform to better prepar them to perform their civic duti of cast educ vote with more than number percent of all potenti voter in this countri possess e-mail account it make sens that polit candid use this medium candid might avoid some of the tactic problem encount by the jone campaign if they use the technolog avail today that better ensur qualiti of e-mail list and target content to specif recipi group but the broader point remain when a polit candid send a voter an e-mail that recipi can choos to delet the messag without open it unsubscrib from the list read it or even repli and engag the sender that choic should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam advoc whose effort are better focus on commerci e-mail polit candid should be free to communic with voter as best they can and let voter decid what to do with that inform -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- mike mccurri former press secretari for presid clinton is ceo of an advocaci
