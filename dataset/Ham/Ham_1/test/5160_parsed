        but when procmail run it it doesn't presum as it     doesn't have the author to communic with the     laptop bee anoth user       i don't know anyth about the kde sound server but i'd guess    your problem is the "environment" in which procmail run you    don't say what procmail is run from in my case for    exampl procmail is run from fetchmail which is run by a cron    job     sorri about that   procmail is run by the qmail deliveri agent to presort all mail   i get   but anyway i found an error messag in procmail.log which solv   the problem   the follow line in my deliveri script seem to work fine now     number artsplay    btw if you use exmhwrapp (found in the misc directory) you can general  this to   display=`cat dollar artsplay  yes but that probabl mean that you have to have exmh run on the laptop to get the notif with exmh get upset by two instanc run at the same time this creat the problem that i cannot run to the closest compter to check out the new mail but thank for the hint i might use that for some other hack ;-) brgds dag _______________________________________________ exmh-us mail list email URL
