 on mon number at number jim whitehead wrote   you have not explain whi the increas in number concentr is not  contribut to increas global temperatur there are a number of reason to think that number is not import to control global temperatur and that much of the number increas may not be anthropogen some recent research point worth mention recent high-resolut studi of histor number concentr and temperatur over hundr of thousand of year have shown a modest correl between the two in a number of case number level increas are not in phase with temperatur increas and actual trail the increas in temperatur by a short time i.e increas in temperatur preced increas in number concentr the more studi that are done of the geolog record the more it seem that number concentr are correl with temperatur increas but are not signific causat there is a lot of evid that number level are regul in a fair stabl fashion i don't believ anyon realli has an authorit answer as to exact how this work yet with respect to absolut number concentr it is also import to point out that our best data to date suggest that they follow a fair regular cycl with a period of about number year at previous cycl peak the concentr were similar to what they are now if this cycl has ani valid (and we onli have good data for number complet cyclic period but which look surpris regular in shape and time) then we should be almost exact at a peak right now as it happen current number concentr are within percent of other previous cyclic concentr peak for which we have good data in other word we may be ad to the number level but it look a lot like we would be build a molehil on top of a mountain in the histor record at the veri least there is noth anomal about current number concentr also number level interact with the biospher in a manner that ultim affect temperatur again the interact is not entir predict but this is believ to be one of the regul negat feedback system mention abov last as greenhous gase go number isn't particular potent although it make up for it in volum in some case gase such as water and methan have a far greater impact as greenhous gase on a per molecul basi water vapor may actual be the key greenhous gas someth that number onli indirect effect through it interact with the biospher number was an easi mark for earli environment but all the recent studi and data i'v seen give me the impress that it is larg a passeng on the climat ride rather than the driver i certain don't think it is a healthi fixat if we'r actual interest in understand warm trend cheer -jame roger email
