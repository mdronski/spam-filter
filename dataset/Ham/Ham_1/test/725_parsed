 quot paul linehan email  what is the gpl all about then number i'm sure you are not _actually_ under the delus that everyth on a typic linux distribut issu subject to the term of the gnu gpl for one thing it seem difficult to imagin you _not_ be awar that number is under the x/mit licenc that perl is under the perl artist licenc that apach is under the apach licenc and that numer bsd util are under the bsd licenc furthermor xv acrobat reader pine pico netscap communic and a whole slew of other applic typic includ aren't under ani open sourc licenc at all but rather are proprietari number you seem in ani event to be under a misconcept as to what the gpl provid as to code under it umbrella it say (in part) that _if_ you have law receiv a copi of cover binari code then you may insist on one of certain form of access to the match sourc code pleas note that it doe _not_ guarante you ani right whatsoev if nobodi decid to give you a law copi  but *_surely_* they cannot bsd linux it not their to bsd again you seem to be under a misconcept if you check i'm quit confid you'll see that suse are in full complianc with gpl v number source-cod access provis concern gpled code includ in their distribut and no nobodi has the legal right to alter licenc term to someon els copyright properti but you have not cite ani reason to believ that suse have done ani of those thing  fine - nobodi can oblig suse to do anyth other than put up the ftp  version but sure they can't prevent a cd owner from burn a copi  and give it to me see below you and the cd owner would be commit copyright violat suse linux ag are rather unlik to knock down your door and haul you down to a judg if that what you'r ask  nobodi can oblig them to give away anyth other than ftp - i'm not  ask for that i'm ask for somebodi who has linux (gpl'ed) to  burn a copi for me and give it to me in exchang for a reason  consider (say the price of the cds and a bottl of frascati or a  coupl of pints?) you appear confus between linux the kernel (which is a copyright work to which sourc code access is guarante under the gnu gpl if you'v receiv a law copi of a binari version) and the rather imprecis concept of a "linux distribution" which is a number of work under divers licenc term collect onto some media in the case of suse box set -- which are not law to duplic and redistribut in their entireti -- at least a coupl of the applic on them (yast number and the instal program) are proprietari copyright work of suse linux ag in the general case duplic and redistribut cd-rom contain those work is copyright infring illeg no amount of hand-wav about the gnu gpl is go to chang that (suse permit peopl to duplic and redistribut the "evaluation" and "live-eval" cd edit despit that fact as long as it is not "for value".) if you want to have a suse box set to instal from buy one  what doe the gpl mean now suggest read it i would guess you'v not yet done so -- cheer live faust die jung rick moen email -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
