 (trim cc list) daniel quinlan said  number these messag could end up be fals (or incorrectly) report  to razor dcc pyzor etc certain rbls too i don't think the  result for these distribut test can be trust in ani way  shape or form when run over a public corpus i'll note that in the readm  number these messag could also be submit (more than once) to project  like spamassassin that reli on filter result submiss for ga  tune and develop  the second problem could be allevi somewhat by ad a nilsimsa  signatur (or similar) to the mass-check file (the result format use  by spamassassin) and give the messag file uniqu name number or  number of each file) ok mayb rewrit the message-id will help here that should allow us to pick them out i'll do that  number spammer could adopt element of the good messag to throw off  filter and of cours there alway progress in technolog  (bi both spammer and non-spammers)  the third problem doesn't realli worri me nah me neither  these problem (and perhap other i have not identified) are uniqu  to spam filter compress corpus and other performance-rel  corpus have their own set of problem of cours   in other word i don't think there ani replac for have  multipl independ corpus find better way to distribut  test and collat result seem like a more viabl long-term solut  (and i'm glad we'r work on exact that for spamassassin) if  you'r go to serious work on filter develop build a corpus  of number messag (half spam/half non-spam) is not realli that  much work if you don't get enough spam creat multi-techniqu  spamtrap (web usenet repli to spam) is pretti easi and who  doesn't get thousand of non-spam everi week ;-) yep the primari reason i releas this was to provid a good big corpus for academ test of filter system it allow result to be compar between filter use a known corpus for spamassassin develop everyon has to maintain their own corpus --j
