i'm run from  cvs on sunday night - the onli chang sinc then was the one you made  this morn for "bulletproof in mhreadseqs"   i run exmh and i can visabl see it count up the number of unseen  messag as it look through the folder - i have about number unseen  messag in mayb number or number folder it take a few second for all  of the folder in the fcach to turn blue this is true...it now look at more than just unseen so it take a littl while (in the background) to build the sequenc window there is probabl some tune possibl in this area  in +inbox i have number unread messag they aren't blue they are  white background with a normal color font i chang the default display of unseen messag from a foreground of blue to a background of white to make it possibl to see what other sequenc unseen messag may be in i *did* ask brent befor i did it if you like the old behavior the old line are still in app-defaults-color but comment out  if i click on a messag i get the follow traceback   invalid command name "mh_markseen"  while execut  "mh_markseen dollar dollar  (procedur "hook_msgshow_update_unseen" line number  invok from within  dollar dollar mimehdr"  (procedur "msgshow" line number  invok from within  "msgshow dollar  (procedur "msgchange" line number  invok from within  "msgchang number show"  invok from within  "time [list msgchang dollar dollar  (procedur "msg_change" line number  invok from within  "msg_chang dollar dollar  (procedur "msg_pick" line number  invok from within  "msg_pick dollar show"  (procedur "ftocrangeend" line number  invok from within  "ftocrangeend [lindex [split [.ftoc.t index current] .] number number  (command bound to event) this is becaus of your hook_msgshow_update_unseen which is call a function which no longer exist i suspect you need seq_del dollar unseen dollar now instead of mh_markseen dollar dollar  it appear that the messag doe get mark as seen though as it  lose the white background and nmh report the same   if i click the flist button it zero the unseen count and then  there is again a visibl delay as it count up all the unseen  messag - mayb number second   i realli think my instal is ok now but if this behavior is just  realli strang i'll blow everyth away and reinstal i'm happi to  spend some time help to track this down i don't realli need exmh  i'm comfort enough use nmh   scott     _______________________________________________  exmh-work mail list  email  URL -- chris garrigu URL vircio URL number congress suit number austin tx number number number number number world war iii the wrong-doer vs the evil-do number content-typ application/pgp-signatur -----begin pgp signature----- version gnupg number (gnu/linux) comment exmh version number number number number number -----end pgp signature----- number _______________________________________________ exmh-work mail list email URL
