it would specifi limit on data valu then remov them then specifi requir element then make them option thus silent break an unknown number of parser around the world - it would encourag use of entity-encod html in it most import element thus ensur both secur risk and unpredict display for the end user - it would ignor year of standard work in other field commit such egregi sin as defin a guid element that wasn't a guid and use an obsolet date format that couldn't easili be sort by date - it primari method of extens would be to add new element to the core namespac without tell anyon or document them thus make it whole resist to dtd schema or valid of ani kind - after year of worldwid deploy it would complet revers it add-whatever-you-w extens rule in favor of namespac which the spec would neither defin nor elabor on - after adopt namespac it would fail to deprec ani exist element semant ident to namespac element alreadi in wide use it would also fail to provid preced rule in case where a document attempt to say the same thing in two differ way thus ensur mass confus among produc and inconsist behavior across consum rss number and number are the whoope cushion and joy buzzer of syndic format for anyon who has tri to accomplish anyth serious with metadata it pretti obvious that of the various implement of a worldwid syndic format we have the worst one possibl except of cours for all the other the problem with that list of rss defici is that it is also a list of number has flourish in a way that no other syndic format has not despit mani of these qualiti but becaus of them the veri weak that make rss so infuri to serious practition also make it possibl in the first place - remov length limit on descript and make titl option open up rss to a whole new categori of produc the weblogg - allow encod html in descript let publish reus both their exist content and the exist rss infrastructur without requir them to produc valid xhtml (which could be embed direct into an xml document) social more rather than technic rule prevent produc from intent introduc secur risk through malici script tag or unpredict display through unclos html element - few publish tool can produc real conform guid and it doesn't matter becaus virtual all rss parser are written in high level languag where handl string is more effici than convert string to bytecod and handl bytecod as for date by convent an rss document is laid out in revers chronolog order and no one seem to be clamor for more flexibl furthermor it almost babyish xml syntax so far from ani serious comput framework (where are the namespac where is the document type descript whi is the aggreg enforc of conform so lax?) made it possibl for anyon want an rss feed to write one the effect of this eas of implement onli becom clear when you compar it to the attempt over the year to number rss number notabl rss number in the year number rss number had three main benefit - backward compat with rss number which was never wide deploy and which fell into obscur as soon as (the much simpler) rss number was introduc - base on rdf (specif a serial call rdf/xml) a spec which at the time and to this day continu to chang or threaten to chang two year later there are no major languag or develop platform that ship with parser to consum rdf although mani (perl python .net) have third-parti rdf parser in various state of develop and conform (the releas version is general out of date cvs access is recommend you get the idea.) meanwhil rdf/xml product tool are so inconsist that even rdf expert recommend not use rdf tool to produc an rss number feed if you want it to actual be read by ani major rss aggreg despit the two-year-old promis of better number it is now the year number and i built my rss number number the most sophist person publish system in the number manual type a mishmash of templat tag and angl bracket into a textarea of an html form - extens through namespac which as mention abov have been haphazard and poor incorpor into rss number where they appear to be flourish evolv number that proceed by be adapt and extend in a thousand small number three main characterist that are german to their eventu victori over strong central design format - onli solut that produc partial result with imperfect tool can succeed my rss feed is an xml document produc by a templat that i built in a textarea and consum by hundr of parser around the world that know noth of xml and hack apart my feed with regular express the world is litter with format that would have work if onli everyon had better tool if everyon in the world had a perfect rdf parser at their dispos it would be trivial to produc and consum all the world metadata in rdf without such perfect tool both product and consumpt instant becom nightmar there is no middl ground - what is is wrong becaus evolv format have alway been adapt to earlier condit and are alway be further adapt to present condit they are alway behind the time rss was be stretch with long descript option titl and entity-encod html even befor such practic were codifi in the spec and long befor all consum could handl them no evolv format is ever perfect in sync with the challeng it face - final orgel rule name for the evolutionari biologist lesli number is clever than you number as with the list of rss obvious defici abov it is easi to point out what is wrong with ani evolv system at ani point in it life no one see rss number and rss number side-by-sid could doubt that rss number had the superior technolog that it number thing number howev the abil to understand what is miss at ani given moment doe not mean that one person or a small central group can design a better system in the long haul design format start out strong and improv logarithm evolv format start out weak and improv exponenti rss number is not the perfect syndic format just the best one that also current practic infrastructur built on evolv format will alway be partial incomplet partial wrong and ultim better design than it competit number URL number number
