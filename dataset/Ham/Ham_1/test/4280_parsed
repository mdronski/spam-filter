highest bidder for while) i think that the most import issu which is that end user won't be abl to fix their system is almost pass over i know that you know this and you allud to it but your essay is get pass around so you might want to add to it bit about the sysadmin and other there one other point which you don't make which i think is veri import which is that research into defin and address class of vulner can't happen without librari of avail vulner code i can think of three research into autom method for address vulner who gripe uninvit about the qualiti of the exist vulner site do research into a set requir that you have enough exampl in the open that you can defin a set and that the set is ad to from time to time so you can make and test predict i feel fair confid in say that without full disclosur we wouldn't have stackguard number nissus or snort and the secur admin job would be a lot harder adam on thu aug number number at number number eugen leitl wrote  --  -- eugen*

---------- forward messag ----------  date thu number aug number number number (edt)  from kragen sitak email  to email  subject the underground softwar vulner marketplac and it hazard   on august number an entiti known as "idefense" sent out an announc  which is append to this email briefli "idefense" which bill  itself as "a global secur intellig company" is offer cash  for inform about secur vulner in comput softwar  that are not public known especi if you promis not to tell  anyon els   if this kind of secret traffic is allow to continu it will pose a  veri serious threat to our comput communic infrastructur   at the moment the domin paradigm for comput secur research  known as "full disclosure" peopl who discov secur  vulner in softwar tell the vendor about them and a short  while later --- after the vendor has had a chanc to fix the problem  --- they publish the inform includ code to exploit the  vulner if possibl   this method has proven far superior to the old paradigm establish by  cert in the late number which it propon might call "respons  disclosure" --- never releas work exploit code and never releas  ani inform on the vulner befor all vendor have releas  a patch this procedur often left hundr of thousand of comput  vulner to known bug for month or year while the vendor work  on featur and often even after the patch were releas peopl  wouldn't appli them becaus they didn't know how serious the problem  was   the underground comput crimin communiti would often discov and  exploit these same hole for month or year while the "respons  disclosure" process kept their victim who had no connect in the  underground vulner   the problem with this is that vulner that are wide known  are much less danger becaus their victim can take step to  reduc their potenti impact --- includ disabl softwar  turn off vulner featur filter traffic in transit and  detect and respond to intrus they are therefor much less  use to would-b intrud also softwar compani usual see  secur vulner in their softwar as pr problem and so  prefer to delay public (and the expens of fix the bugs) as  long as possibl   idefens is offer a new altern that appear far more danger  than either of the two previous paradigm they want to be a buyer in  a marketplac for secret softwar vulner inform reward  discover of vulner with cash   not long befor snosoft a group of secur research evid  includ some crimin element appar made an offer to sell the  secreci of some softwar vulner inform to the softwar  vendor specif they appar made a privat offer to  hewlett-packard to keep a vulner in hp number unix secret if  hp retain snosoft "consult services" hp consid this  extort and respond with legal threat and snosoft publish the  inform   if this is allow to happen it will caus two problem which  togeth add up to a catastroph   first secret softwar vulner inform will be avail to  the highest bidder and to nobodi els for reason explain later  i think the highest bidder will general be organ crime  syndic although that will not be obvious to the seller   second find softwar vulner and keep them secret will  becom lucrat for mani more talent peopl the result will be  --- just as in the "respons disclosure" day --- that the good  guy will remain vulner for month and year while the major  of current vulner are kept secret   i'v heard it argu that the highest bidder will general be the  vendor of the vulner softwar but i don't think that  plausibl if someon can steal number number becaus a softwar bug let  them the softwar vendor is never held liabl often in fact the  peopl who administ the softwar aren't liabl either --- when  credit card data are stolen from an e-commerc site for exampl  know about a vulner befor anyon els might save a web-sit  administr some time and it might save the softwar vendor some  negat pr but it can net the thief thousand of dollar   i think the highest bidder will be those for whom earli vulner  inform is most lucrat --- the thiev who can use it to  execut the largest heist without get caught inevit that  mean organ crime syndic although the particular gang who  are good at network theft may not yet exist   there might be the occasion case where a market leader such as  microsoft could make more money by give their competitor bad pr  than a gang could make by theft think of a remote-root hole in  samba for exampl   right now peopl who know how to find secur exploit are either  motiv by person interest in the subject motiv by the public  interest motiv by a desir for individu recognit or  person know crimin that benefit from their exploit creat  a marketplac in secret vulner inform would vast  increas the avail of that inform to the peopl who can  afford to pay the most for it spi terrorist and organ crime   let not let that happen      this is the origin idefens announc   from sunil jame email  sent wednesday august number number number pm  subject introduc idefens vulner

not publish  secur research for compens rather it could be for ani of a number  of motiv includ the follow   * pure love of secur research  * the desir to protect against harm to target network  * the
