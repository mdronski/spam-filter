 ------------------------ yahoo group sponsor  number dvds free +s&p join now number  a new version of unison is now avail for test it incorpor sever small improv over number but the main chang is a fix to a bug that had potenti serious safeti consequ but onli for the veri small number of user that are in the habit of run more than one instanc of unison at a time in parallel these user are strong encourag to upgrad other can wait if they wish the releas includ pre-built execut for linux and solari but not window (we are look for a unison-window maintain -- at the moment none of the activ develop are regular use unison on window and we do not have a machin that is configur proper for build execut for export.) grab it from here URL enjoy -- benjamin chang sinc number * ad a prefer maxthread that can be use to limit the number of simultan file transfer * ad a backupdir prefer which control where backup file are store * basic support ad for osx in particular unison now recogn when one of the host be synchron is run osx and switch to a case-insensit treatment of filenam (i.e. foo and foo are consid to be the same file) (osx is not yet fulli work howev in particular file with resourc fork will not be synchron correctly.) * the same hash use to form the archiv name is now also ad to the name of the temp file creat dure file transfer the reason for this is that dure updat detect we are go to silent delet ani old temp file that we find along the way and we want to prevent ourselv from delet temp file belong to other instanc of unison that may be run in parallel e.g synchron with a differ host thank to ruslan ermilov for this suggest * sever small user interfac improv * document + faq and bug report instruct have been split out as separ html page access direct from the unison web page + addit to faq in particular suggest about perform tune * makefil + makefile.ocaml now set uistyle=text or uistyle=gtk automat depend on whether it find lablgtk instal + unison should now compil ``out of the box' under osx chang sinc number * chang profil work again under window * file movement optim unison now tri to use local copi instead of transfer for move or copi file it is control by a boolean option ``xferbycopying' * network statist window (transfer rate amount of data transferred) [nb not avail in windows-cygwin version.] * symlink work under the cygwin version (which is dynam linked) * fix potenti deadlock when synchron between window and unix * small improv + if neither the tt userprofil nor the tt home environ variabl are set then unison will put it temporari commit log (call tt danger.readme) into the directori name by the tt unison environ variabl if ani otherwis it will use tt c: + altern set of valu for fastcheck yes = true no = fals default = auto + -silent impli -contactquiet * sourc code + code reorgan and tidi (start break up some of the basic util modul so that the non-unison-specif stuff can be made avail for other projects.) + sever makefil and doc chang (for release) + further comment in ``update.ml' + connect inform is not store in global variabl anymor chang sinc number * small bugfix to textual user interfac under unix (to avoid leav the termin in a bad state where it would not echo input after unison exited) chang sinc number * improv to the main web page (stabl and beta version doc are now both accessible) * user manual revis * ad some new prefer + ``sshcmd' and ``rshcmd' for specifi path to ssh and rsh program + ``contactquietly' for suppress the ``contact server' messag dure unison startup (under the graphic ui) * bug fix + fix small bug in ui that neglect to chang the display column header if load a new profil caus the root to chang + fix a bug that would put the text ui into an infinit loop if it encount a conflict when run in batch mode + ad some code to tri to fix the display of non-ascii charact in filenam on window system in the gtk ui (this code is current untested---if you'r one of the peopl that had report problem with display of non-ascii filenam we'd appreci know if this actual fix things.) + `-prefer/-forc newer work proper now (the bug was report by sebastian urbaniak and sean fulton.) * user interfac and unison behavior + renam `proce to `go in the graphic ui + ad exit status for the textual user interfac + path that are not synchron becaus of conflict or error dure updat detect are now note in the log file + [end] messag in log now use a briefer format + chang the text ui startup sequenc so that tt ./unison -ui text will use the default profil instead of fail + made some improv to the error messag + ad some debug messag to remote.ml chang sinc number * incorpor onc again a multi-thread transport sub-system it transfer sever file at the same time therebi make much more effect use of avail network bandwidth unlik the earlier attempt this time we do not reli on the nativ thread librari of ocaml instead we implement a light-weight non-preempt multi-thread librari in ocaml direct this version appear stabl some adjust to unison are made to accommod the multi-thread version these includ in particular chang to the user interfac and log for exampl + two log entri for each transfer task one for the begin one for the end + suppress warn messag against remov temp file left by a previous unison run becaus warn doe not work nice under multi-thread the temp file name are made less like to coincid with the name of a file creat by the user they take the form  * ad a new command to the gtk user interfac press f caus unison to start a new updat detect phase use as path just those path that have been detect as chang and not yet mark as success complet use this command to quick restart unison on just the set of path still need attent after a previous run * made the ignorecas prefer user-vis and chang the initi code so that it can be manual set to true even if neither host is run window (this may be use e.g. when use unison run on a unix system with a fat volum mounted.) * small improv and bug fix + error in prefer file now generat fatal error rather than warn at startup time (i.e. you can't go on from them.) also we fix a bug that was prevent these warn from appear in the text ui so some user who have been run (unsuspectingly) with garbag in their pref file may now get error report + error report for prefer file now provid file name and line number + more intellig messag in the case of ident chang to the same file ``noth to do replica have been chang onli in ident way sinc last sync.' + file with prefix .# exclud when scan for prefer file + rsync instruct are send direct instead of first marshal + won't tri forev to get the fingerprint of a continu chang file unison will give up after certain number of retri + other bug fix includ the one report by peter seling (force=old prefer not working) * compil + upgrad to the new ocaml number compil with the lablgtk number librari (patch version use for compil under windows) + ad the option to compil unison on the window platform with cygwin gnu c compil this option onli support build dynam link unison execut chang sinc number * fix a silli (but debilitating) bug in the client startup sequenc chang sinc number * ad addprefsto prefer which (when set) control which prefer file new prefer (e.g new ignor patterns) are ad to * bug fix read the initi connect header one byte at a time so that we don't block if the header is shorter than expect (this bug did not affect normal oper --- it just made it hard to tell when you were tri to use unison incorrect with an old version of the server sinc it would hang instead of give an error message.) chang sinc number * chang fastcheck from a boolean to a string prefer it legal valu are yes (for a fast check) no (for a safe check) or default (for a fast check---which also happen to be safe---when run on unix and a safe check when on windows) the default is default * sever prefer have been renam for consist all prefer name are now spell out in lowercas for backward compat the old name still work but they are not mention in the manual ani more * the temp file creat by the diff and merg command are now name by prepend a new prefix to the file name rather than append a suffix this should avoid confus diff/merg program that depend on the suffix to guess the type of the file content * we now set the keepal option on the server socket to make sure that the server time out if the communic link is unexpect broken * bug fix + when updat small file unison now close the destin file + file permiss are proper updat when the file is behind a follow link + sever other small fix chang sinc number * major window perform improv we'v ad a prefer fastcheck that make unison look onli at a file creation time and last-modifi time to check whether it has chang this should result in a huge speedup when check for updat in larg replica when this switch is set unison will use file creation time as pseudo inod number when scan window replica for updat instead of read the full content of everi file this may caus unison to miss propag an updat if the creat time modif time and length of the file are all unchang by the updat (this is not easi to achiev but it can be done) howev unison will never overwrit such an updat with a chang from the other replica sinc it alway doe a safe check for updat just befor propag a chang thus it is reason to use this switch most of the time and occasion run unison onc with fastcheck set to fals if you are worri that unison may have overlook an updat warn this chang is has not yet been thorough field-test if you set the fastcheck prefer pay care attent to what unison is do * new function central backup and merg + this version incorpor two piec of major new function implement by sylvain roy dure a summer internship at penn a central backup facil that keep a full backup of (select file in) each replica and a merg featur that allow unison to invok an extern file-merg tool to resolv conflict chang to individu file + central backup o unison now maintain full backup of the last-synchron version of (some of) the file in each replica these function both as backup in the usual sens and as the ``common version' when invok extern merg program o the back up file are store in a directori /.unison/backup on each host (the name of this directori can be chang by set the environ variabl unisonbackupdir.) o the predic backup control which file are actual back up give the prefer backup = path *' caus back up of all file o file are ad to the backup directori whenev unison updat it archiv this mean that # when unison reconstruct it archiv from scratch (e.g. becaus of an upgrad or becaus the archiv file have been manual deleted) all file will be back up # otherwis each file will be back up the first time unison propag an updat for it o the prefer backupvers control how mani previous version of each file are kept the default is number (i.e. the last synchron version plus one backup) o for backward compat the backup prefer is also still support but backup is now prefer o it is ok to manual delet file from the backup directori (or to throw away the directori itself) befor unison use ani of these file for anyth import it check that it fingerprint match the one that it expect + merg o both user interfac offer a new merg command invok by press m (with a chang file selected) o the actual merg is perform by an extern program the prefer merg and number control how this program is invok if a backup exist for this file (see the backup preference) then the merg prefer is use for this purpos otherwis number is use in both case the valu of the prefer should be a string repres the command that should be pass to a shell to invok the merg program within this string the special substr number number new and old may appear at ani point unison will substitut these as follow befor invok the command # number is replac by the name of the local copi of the file # number is replac by the name of a temporari file into which the content of the remot copi of the file have been transfer by unison prior to perform the merg # new is replac by the name of a temporari file that unison expect to be written by the merg program when it finish give the desir new content of the file and # old is replac by the name of the back up copi of the origin version of the file (i.e. it state at the end of the last success run of unison) if one exist (appli onli to merg not number for exampl on unix system set the merg prefer to merg = number -m number old number  new will tell unison to use the extern number program for merg a larg number of extern merg program are avail for exampl emac user may find the follow conveni number = emac -q --eval (ediff-merge-fil number number nil "new") merg = emac -q --eval (ediff-merge-files-with-ancestor number number "old" nil "new") (these command are display here on two line to avoid run off the edg of the page in your prefer file each should be written on a singl line.) o if the extern program exit without leav ani file at the path new unison consid the merg to have fail if the merg program write a file call new but exit with a non-zero status code then unison consid the merg to have succeed but to have generat conflict in this case it attempt to invok an extern editor so that the user can resolv the conflict the valu of the editor prefer control what editor is invok by unison the default is emac o pleas send us suggest for other use valu of the number and merg prefer -- we'd like to give sever exampl in the manual * smaller chang + when one prefer file includ anoth unison no longer add the suffix .prf to the includ file by default if a file with precis the given name exist in the .unison directori it will be use otherwis unison will add .prf as it did befor (this chang mean that includ prefer file can be name blah.includ instead of blah.prf so that unison will not offer them in it choos a prefer file dialog.) + for linux system we now offer both a static link and a dynam link execut the static one is larger but will probabl run on more system sinc it doesn't depend on the same version of dynam link librari modul be avail + fix the forc and prefer prefer which were get the propag direct exact backward + fix a bug in the startup code that would caus unison to crash when the default profil (~/.unison/default.prf) doe not exist + fix a bug where on the run when a profil is first creat unison would confus display the root in revers order in the user interfac * for develop + we'v ad a modul depend diagram to the sourc distribut in src/dependencies.p to help new prospect develop with navig the code chang sinc number * incompat chang archiv format has chang * incompat chang the startup sequenc has been complet rewritten and great simplifi the main user-vis chang is that the defaultpath prefer has been remov it effect can be approxim by use multipl profil with includ direct to incorpor common set all use of defaultpath in exist profil should be chang to path anoth chang in startup behavior that will affect some user is that it is no longer possibl to specifi root both in the profil and on the command line you can achiev a similar effect though by break your profil into two default.prf = root = blah root = foo includ common common.prf =   now do unison common number number when you want to specifi root explicit * the -prefer and -forc option have been extend to allow user to specifi that file with more recent modtim should be propag write either -prefer newer or -forc newer (for symmetri unison will also accept -prefer older or -forc older.) the -forc older/new option can onli be use when -time is also set the graphic user interfac provid access to these facil on a one-off basi via the action menu * name of root can now be ``aliased' to allow replica to be reloc without chang the name of the archiv file where unison store inform between run (this featur is for expert onli see the ``archiv files' section of the manual for more information.) * graphic user-interfac + a new command is provid in the synchron menu for switch to a new profil without restart unison from scratch + the gui also support one-key shortcut for common use profil if a profil contain a prefer of the form key = n' where n is a singl digit then press this key will caus unison to immedi switch to this profil and begin synchron again from scratch (ani action that may have been select for a set of chang current be display will be discarded.) + each profil may includ a prefer label =  give a descript string that describ the option select in this profil the string is list along with the profil name in the profil select dialog and display in the top-right corner of the main unison window * minor + fix a bug that would sometim caus the diff display to order the file backward relat to the main user interfac (thank to pascal brisset for this fix.) + on unix system the graphic version of unison will check the display variabl and if it is not set automat fall back to the textual user interfac + synchron path (path preferences) are now match against the ignor prefer so if a path is both specifi in a path prefer and ignor it will be skip + numer other bugfix and small improv chang sinc number * the synchron of modif time has been disabl for directori * prefer file may now includ line of the form includ  which will caus name.prf to be read at that point * the synchron of permiss between window and unix now work proper * a bind cygwin=binmod in now ad to the environ so that the cygwin port of openssh work proper in a non-cygwin context * the servercmd and addversionno prefer can now be use togeth -addversionno append an appropri -nnn to the server command which is found by use the valu of the -servercmd prefer if there is one or els just unison * both -pref=val and -pref val are now allow for boolean valu (the former can be use to set a prefer to false.) * lot of small bug fix chang sinc number * the log prefer is now set to true by default sinc the log file seem use for most user * sever miscellan bugfix (most involv symlinks) chang sinc number * incompat chang archiv format has chang (again) * sever signific bug introduc in number have been fix chang sinc number * incompat chang archiv format has chang make sure you synchron your replica befor upgrad to avoid spurious conflict the first sync after upgrad will be slow * new function + unison now synchron file modtim user-id and group-id these new featur are control by a set of new prefer all of which are current fals by default o when the time prefer is set to true file modif time are propag (becaus the represent of time may not have the same granular on both replica unison may not alway be abl to make the modtim precis equal but it will get them as close as the oper system involv allow.) o when the owner prefer is set to true file ownership inform is synchron o when the group prefer is set to true group inform is synchron o when the numericid prefer is set to true owner and group inform is synchron numer by default owner and group number are convert to name on each replica and these name are synchron (the special user id number and the special group number are never map via user/group name even if this prefer is not set.) + ad an integer-valu prefer perm that can be use to control the propag of permiss bit the valu of this prefer is a mask indic which permiss bit should be synchron it is set by default to number all bit but the set-uid and set-gid bit are synchronis (synchron these latter bit can be a secur hazard) if you want to synchron all bit you can set the valu of this prefer to number + ad a log prefer (default false) which make unison keep a complet record of the chang it make to the replica by default this record is written to a file call unison.log in the user home directori (the valu of the home environ variable) if you want it someplac els set the logfil prefer to the full pathnam you want unison to use + ad an ignorenot prefer that maintain a set of pattern for path that should definit not be ignor whether or not they match an ignor pattern (that is a path will now be ignor iff it match an ignor pattern and doe not match ani ignorenot patterns.) * user-interfac improv + root are now display in the user interfac in the same order as they were given on the command line or in the prefer file + when the batch prefer is set the graphic user interfac no longer wait for user confirm when it display a warn messag it simpli pop up an advisori window with a dismiss button at the bottom and keep on go + ad a new prefer for control how mani status messag are print dure updat detect statusdepth control the maximum depth for path on the local machin (longer path are not display nor are non-directori paths) the valu should be an integ default is number + remov the trace and silent prefer they did not seem veri use and there were too mani prefer for control output in various way + the text ui now display just the default command (the one that will be use if the user just type  instead of all avail command type  will print the full list of possibl + the function that find the canon hostnam of the local host (which is use for exampl in calcul the name of the archiv file use to rememb which file have been synchronized) normal use the gethostnam oper system call howev if the environ variabl unisonlocalhostnam is set it valu will now be use instead this make it easier to use unison in situat where a machin name chang frequent (e.g. becaus it is a laptop and get move around a lot) + file owner and group are now display in the ``detail window' at the bottom of the screen when unison is configur to synchron them * for hacker + updat to jacqu garrigu new version of lablgtk which mean we can throw away our local patch version if you'r compil the gtk version of unison from sourc you'll need to updat your copi of lablgtk to the develop releas avail from URL (warn instal lablgtk under window is current a bit challenging.) + the todo.txt file (in the sourc distribution) has been clean up and reorgan the list of pend task should be much easier to make sens of for peopl that may want to contribut their program energi there is also a separ file bugs.txt for open bug + the tk user interfac has been remov (it was not be maintain and no longer compiles) + the debug prefer now print quit a bit of addit inform that should be use for identifi sourc of problem + the version number of the remot server is now check right away dure the connect setup handshak rather than later (somebodi sent a bug report of a server crash that turn out to come from use inconsist version better to check this earlier and in a way that can't crash either client or server.) + unison now run correct on number architectur (e.g alpha linux) we will not be distribut binari for these architectur ourselv (at least for a while) but if someon would like to make them avail we'll be glad to provid a link to them * bug fix + pattern match (e.g for ignore) is now case-insensit when unison is in case-insensit mode (i.e. when one of the replica is on a window machine) + some peopl had troubl with mysteri failur dure propag of updat where file would be fals report as have chang dure synchron this should be fix + numer smaller fix chang sinc number * ad a number of sort mode for the user interfac by default conflict chang are display at the top and the rest of the entri are sort in alphabet order this behavior can be chang in the follow way + set the sortnewfirst prefer to true caus newli creat file to be display befor chang file + set sortbys caus file to be display in increas order of size + give the prefer  (where  is a path descriptor in the same format as ignor and follow pattern caus path match this pattern to be display first + similar give the prefer  caus path match this pattern to be display last the sort prefer are describ in more detail in the user manual the sortnewfirst and sortbys flag can also be access from the sort menu in the grpahic user interfac * ad two new prefer that can be use to chang unison fundament behavior to make it more like a mirror tool instead of a synchron + give the prefer prefer with argument  (bi ad -prefer  to the command line or  to your profile) mean that if there is a conflict the content of  should be propag to the other replica (with no question asked) non-conflict chang are treat as usual + give the prefer forc with argument  will make unison resolv all differ in favor of the given root even if it was the other replica that was chang these option should be use with care (more inform is avail in the manual.) * small chang + chang default answer to yes in all two-button dialog in the graphic interfac (this seem more intuitive) + the rsync prefer has been remov (it was use to activ rsync compress for file transfer but rsync compress is now enabl by default) + in the text user interfac the arrow indic which direct chang are be propag are print differ when the user has overrid unison default recommend  instead of  this match the behavior of the graphic interfac which display such arrow in a differ color + carriag return (control-m's) are ignor at the end of line in profil for window compat + all prefer are now fulli document in the user manual chang sinc number * incompat chang archiv format has chang make sure you synchron your replica befor upgrad to avoid spurious conflict the first sync after upgrad will be slow * new/improv function + a new prefer -sortbys control the order in which chang are display to the user when it is set to true the smallest chang file are display first (the default set is false.) + a new prefer -sortnewfirst caus newli creat file to be list befor other updat in the user interfac + we now allow the ssh protocol to specifi a port + incompat chang the unison protocol is deprec and we ad file and socket: you may have to modifi your profil in the .unison directori if a replica is specifi without an explicit protocol we now assum it refer to a file (previous "//saul/foo" meant to use ssh to connect to saul then access the foo directori now it mean to access saul via a remot file mechan such as samba the old effect is now achiev by write ssh://saul/foo.) + chang the startup sequenc for the case where root are given but no profil is given on the command line the new behavior is to use the default profil (creat it if it doe not exist) and temporarili overrid it root the manual claim that this case would work by read no profil at all but afaik this was never true + in all user interfac file with conflict are alway list first + a new prefer sshversion can be use to control which version of ssh should be use to connect to the server legal valu are number and number (default is empti which will make unison use whatev version of ssh is instal as the default ssh command.) + the situat when the permiss of a file was updat the same on both side is now handl correct (we use to report a spurious conflict) * improv for the window version + the fact that filenam are treat case-insensit under window should now be handl correct the exact behavior is describ in the cross-platform section of the manual + it should be possibl to synchron with window share e.g. //host/drive/path + workaround to the bug in sync root directori in window the most difficult thing to fix is an ocaml bug unix.opendir fail on c in some version of window * improv to the gtk user interfac (the tk interfac is no longer be maintained) + the ui now display action differ (in blue) when they have been explicit chang by the user from unison default recommend + more color appear + the initi profil select window work better + if ani transfer fail a messag to this effect is display along with synchron complet at the end of the transfer phase (in case they may have scroll off the top) + ad a global progress meter display the percentag of total byte that have been transfer so far * improv to the text user interfac + the file detail will be display automat when a conflict is been detect + when a warn is generat (e.g for a temporari file left over from a previous run of unison) unison will no longer wait for a respons if it is run in -batch mode + the ui now display a short list of possibl input each time it wait for user interact + the ui now quit immedi (rather than loop back and start the interact again) if the user press q when ask whether to propag chang + press g in the text user interfac will proceed immedi with propag updat without ask ani more question * document and instal chang + the manual now includ a faq plus section on common problem and on trick contribut by user + both the download page and the download directori explicit say what are the current stabl and beta-test version number + the ocaml sourc for the up-to-the-minut develop version (not guarante to be stabl or even to compil at ani given time!) are now avail from the download page + ad a subsect to the manual describ cross-platform issu (case conflict illeg filenames) * mani small bug fix and random improv chang sinc number * sever bug fix the most import is a bug in the rsync modul that would occasion caus chang propag to fail with a renam error chang sinc number * the multi-thread transport system is now disabl by default (it is not stabl enough yet.) * various bug fix * a new experiment featur the final compon of a -path argument may now be the wildcard specifi * when unison see such a path it expand this path on the client into into the correspond list of path by list the content of that directori note that if you use wildcard path from the command line you will probabl need to use quot or a backslash to prevent the * from be interpret by your shell if both root are local the content of the first one will be use for expand wildcard path (nb this is the first one after the canon step -- i.e. the one that is list first in the user interfac -- not the one list first on the command line or in the prefer file.) chang sinc number * the transport subsystem now includ an implement by sylvain gommier and norman ramsey of tridgel and mackerra rsync protocol this protocol achiev much faster transfer when onli a small part of a larg file has been chang by send just diff this featur is main help for transfer over slow links---on fast local area network it can actual degrad performance---so we have left it off by default start unison with the -rsync option (or put rsync=tru in your prefer file) to turn it on * ``progress bars' are now diplay dure remot file transfer show what percentag of each file has been transfer so far * the version number scheme has chang new releas will now be have number like number where the second compon is increment on everi signific public releas and the third compon is the ``patch level.' * miscellan improv to the gtk-base user interfac * the manual is now avail in pdf format * we are experi with use a multi-thread transport subsystem to transfer sever file at the same time make much more effect use of avail network bandwidth this featur is not complet stabl yet so by default it is disabl in the releas version of unison if you want to play with the multi-thread version you'll need to recompil unison from sourc (as describ in the documentation) set the thread flag in makefile.ocaml to true make sure that your ocaml compil has been instal with the -with-pthread configur option (you can verifi this by check whether the file threads/threads.cma in the ocaml standard librari directori contain the string -lpthread near the end.) chang sinc number * reduc memori footprint (this is especi import dure the first run of unison where it has to gather inform about all the file in both repositories) * fix a bug that would caus the socket server under nt to fail after the client exit * ad a shift modifi to the ignor menu shortcut key in gtk interfac (to avoid hit them accidentally) chang sinc number * tunnel over ssh is now support in the window version see the instal section of the manual for detail instruct * the transport subsystem now includ an implement of the rsync protocol built by sylvain gommier and norman ramsey this protocol achiev much faster transfer when onli a small part of a larg file has been chang by send just diff the rsync featur is off by default in the current version use the -rsync switch to turn it on (nb we still have a lot of tune to do you may not notic much speedup yet.) * we'r experi with a multi-thread transport subsystem written by jerom vouillon the download binari are still single-thread if you want to tri the multi-thread version you'll need to recompil from sourc (say make threads=true.) nativ thread support from the compil is requir use the option -thread n to select the maxim number of concurr thread (default is number multi-thread and single-thread clients/serv can interoper * a new gtk-base user interfac is now avail thank to jacqu garrigu the tk user interfac still work but we'll be shift develop effort to the gtk interfac from now on * ocaml number is now requir for compil unison from sourc the modul uitk and myfileselect have been chang to use labltk instead of camltk to compil the tk interfac in window you must have number and number when instal number put it in c:\tcl rather than the suggest c:\program files\tcl and be sure to instal the header and librari (which are not instal by default) * ad a new -addversionno switch which caus unison to use  instead of just unison as the remot server command this allow multipl version of unison to coexist conveni on the same server whichev version is run on the client the same version will be select on the server chang sinc number * incompat chang archiv format has chang make sure you synchron your replica befor upgrad to avoid spurious conflict the first sync after upgrad will be slow * this version fix sever annoy bug includ + some case where propag of file permiss was not work + umask is now ignor when creat directori + directori are creat writabl so that a read-on directori and it content can be propag + handl of warn generat by the server + synchron a path whose parent is not a directori on both side is now flag as erron + fix some bug relat to symnbol link and nonexist root o when a chang (delet or new contents) is propag onto a follow' symlink the file point to by the link is now chang (we use to chang the link itself which doesn't fit our assert that follow mean the link is complet invisible) o when one root did not exist propag the other root on top of it use to fail becuas unison could not calcul the work directori into which to write chang this should be fix * a human-read timestamp has been ad to unison archiv file * the semant of path and name regular express now correspond better * some minor improv to the text ui (e.g a command for go back to previous items) * the organ of the export directori has chang --- should be easier to find / download thing now chang sinc number * incompat chang archiv format has chang make sure you synchron your replica befor upgrad to avoid spurious conflict the first sync after upgrad will be slow * this version has not been test extens on window * major intern chang design to make unison safer to run at the same time as the replica are be chang by the user * intern perform improv chang sinc number * incompat chang archiv format has chang make sure you synchron your replica befor upgrad to avoid spurious conflict the first sync after upgrad will be slow * a number of intern function have been chang to reduc the amount of memori alloc especi dure the first synchron this should help power user with veri big replica * reimplement of low-level remot procedur call stuff in prepar for ad rsync-lik smart file transfer in a later releas * miscellan bug fix chang sinc number * incompat chang archiv format has chang make sure you synchron your replica befor upgrad to avoid spurious conflict the first sync after upgrad will be slow * fix some small bug in the interpret of ignor pattern * fix some problem that were prevent the window version from work correct when click-start * fix to treatment of file permiss under window which were caus spurious report of differ permiss when synchron between window and unix system * fix one more non-tail-recurs list process function which was caus stack overflow when synchron veri larg replica chang sinc number * the text user interfac now provid command for ignor file * we found and fix some more non-tail-recurs list process function some power user have report success with veri larg replica * incompat chang file end in .tmp are no longer ignor automat if you want to ignor such file put an appropri ignor pattern in your profil * incompat chang the syntax of ignor and follow pattern has chang instead of put a line of the form ignor =  in your profil (.unison/default.prf) you should put ignor = regexp  moreov two other style of pattern are also recogn ignor = name  match ani path in which one compon match  while ignor = path  match exact the path  standard ``globbing' convent can be use in  and  + a  match ani singl charact except / + a * match ani sequenc of

overflow when synchron huge directori we found and fix some non-tail-recurs list process function which we hope will solv the problem pleas give it a tri and let us know * major addit to the document chang sinc number * major intern tidi and mani small bugfix * major addit to the user manual * unison can now be start with no argument -- it will prompt automat for the name of a profil file contain the root to be synchron this make it possibl to start the graphic ui from a desktop icon * fix a small bug where the text ui on nt was rais a no such signal except chang sinc number * the precompil window binari in the last releas was compil with an old ocaml compil caus propag of permiss not to work (and perhap lead to some other strang behavior we'v heard report about) this has been correct if you'r use precompil binari on window pleas upgrad * ad a -debug command line flag which control debug of various modul say -debug xxx to enabl debug trace for modul xxx or -debug all to turn on absolut everyth * fix a small bug where the text ui on nt was rais a no such signal except chang sinc number * incompat chang the name and format of the prefer file in the .unison directori have chang in particular + the file ``prefs' should be renam to default.prf + the content of the file ``ignore' should be merg into default.prf each line of the form regexp in ignor should becom a line of the form ignor = regexp in default.prf * unison now handl permiss bit and symbol link see the manual for detail * you can now have differ prefer file in your .unison directori if you start unison like this unison profilenam (i.e with just one ``anonymous' command-lin argument) then the file ~/.unison/profilename.prf will be load instead of default.prf * some improv to termin handl in the text user interfac * ad a switch -killserv that termin the remot server process when the unison client is shut down even when use socket for communic (bi default a remot server creat use ssh/rsh is termin automat while a socket server is left running.) * when start in socket server mode unison print server start on stderr when it is readi to accept connect (this may be use for script that want to tell when a socket-mod server has finish initalization.) * we now make a night mirror of our current intern develop tree in case anyon want an up-to-the-minut version to hack around with * ad a file contrib with some suggest for how to help us make unison better chang in version number chang sinc number * ad a prefer maxthread that can be use to limit the number of simultan file transfer * ad a backupdir prefer which control where backup file are store * basic support ad for osx in particular unison now recogn when one of the host be synchron is run osx and switch to a case-insensit treatment of filenam (i.e. foo and foo are consid to be the same file) (osx is not yet fulli work howev in particular file with resourc fork will not be synchron correctly.) * the same hash use to form the archiv name is now also ad to the name of the temp file creat dure file transfer the reason for this is that dure updat detect we are go to silent delet ani old temp file that we find along the way and we want to prevent ourselv from delet temp file belong to other instanc of unison that may be run in parallel e.g synchron with a differ host thank to ruslan ermilov for this suggest * sever small user interfac improv * document + faq and bug report instruct have been split out as separ html page access direct from the unison web page + addit to faq in particular suggest about perform tune * makefil + makefile.ocaml now set uistyle=text or uistyle=gtk automat depend on whether it find lablgtk instal + unison should now compil ``out of the box' under osx chang sinc number * chang profil work again under window * file movement optim unison now tri to use local copi instead of transfer for move or copi file it is control by a boolean option ``xferbycopying' * network statist window (transfer rate amount of data transferred) [nb not avail in windows-cygwin version.] * symlink work under the cygwin version (which is dynam linked) * fix potenti deadlock when synchron between window and unix * small improv + if neither the tt userprofil nor the tt home environ variabl are set then unison will put it temporari commit log (call tt danger.readme) into the directori name by the tt unison environ variabl if ani otherwis it will use tt c: + altern set of valu for fastcheck yes = true no = fals default = auto + -silent impli -contactquiet * sourc code + code reorgan and tidi (start break up some of the basic util modul so that the non-unison-specif stuff can be made avail for other projects.) + sever makefil and doc chang (for release) + further comment in ``update.ml' + connect inform is not store in global variabl anymor chang sinc number * small bugfix to textual user interfac under unix (to avoid leav the termin in a bad state where it would not echo input after unison exited) chang sinc number * improv to the main web page (stabl and beta version doc are now both accessible) * user manual revis * ad some new prefer + ``sshcmd' and ``rshcmd' for specifi path to ssh and rsh program + ``contactquietly' for suppress the ``contact server' messag dure unison startup (under the graphic ui) * bug fix + fix small bug in ui that neglect to chang the display column header if load a new profil caus the root to chang + fix a bug that would put the text ui into an infinit loop if it encount a conflict when run in batch mode + ad some code to tri to fix the display of non-ascii charact in filenam on window system in the gtk ui (this code is current untested---if you'r one of the peopl that had report problem with display of non-ascii filenam we'd appreci know if this actual fix things.) + `-prefer/-forc newer work proper now (the bug was report by sebastian urbaniak and sean fulton.) * user interfac and unison behavior + renam `proce to `go in the graphic ui + ad exit status for the textual user interfac + path that are not synchron becaus of conflict or error dure updat detect are now note in the log file + [end] messag in log now use a briefer format + chang the text ui startup sequenc so that tt ./unison -ui text will use the default profil instead of fail + made some improv to the error messag + ad some debug messag to remote.ml chang sinc number * incorpor onc again a multi-thread transport sub-system it transfer sever file at the same time therebi make much more effect use of avail network bandwidth unlik the earlier attempt this time we do not reli on the nativ thread librari of ocaml instead we implement a light-weight non-preempt multi-thread librari in ocaml direct this version appear stabl some adjust to unison are made to accommod the multi-thread version these includ in particular chang to the user interfac and log for exampl + two log entri for each transfer task one for the begin one for the end + suppress warn messag against remov temp file left by a previous unison run becaus warn doe not work nice under multi-thread the temp file name are made less like to coincid with the name of a file creat by the user they take the form  * ad a new command to the gtk user interfac press f caus unison to start a new updat detect phase use as path just those path that have been detect as chang and not yet mark as success complet use this command to quick restart unison on just the set of path still need attent after a previous run * made the ignorecas prefer user-vis and chang the initi code so that it can be manual set to true even if neither host is run window (this may be use e.g. when use unison run on a unix system with a fat volum mounted.) * small improv and bug fix + error in prefer file now generat fatal error rather than warn at startup time (i.e. you can't go on from them.) also we fix a bug that was prevent these warn from appear in the text ui so some user who have been run (unsuspectingly) with garbag in their pref file may now get error report + error report for prefer file now provid file name and line number + more intellig messag in the case of ident chang to the same file ``noth to do replica have been chang onli in ident way sinc last sync.' + file with prefix .# exclud when scan for prefer file + rsync instruct are send direct instead of first marshal + won't tri forev to get the fingerprint of a continu chang file unison will give up after certain number of retri + other bug fix includ the one report by peter seling (force=old prefer not working) * compil + upgrad to the new ocaml number compil with the lablgtk number librari (patch version use for compil under windows) + ad the option to compil unison on the window platform with cygwin gnu c compil this option onli support build dynam link unison execut chang sinc number * fix a silli (but debilitating) bug in the client startup sequenc chang sinc number * ad addprefsto prefer which (when set) control which prefer file new prefer (e.g new ignor patterns) are ad to * bug fix read the initi connect header one byte at a time so that we don't block if the header is shorter than expect (this bug did not affect normal oper --- it just made it hard to tell when you were tri to use unison incorrect with an old version of the server sinc it would hang instead of give an error message.) chang sinc number * chang fastcheck from a boolean to a string prefer it legal valu are yes (for a fast check) no (for a safe check) or default (for a fast check---which also happen to be safe---when run on unix and a safe check when on windows) the default is default * sever prefer have been renam for consist all prefer name are now spell out in lowercas for backward compat the old name still work but they are not mention in the manual ani more * the temp file creat by the diff and merg command are now name by prepend a new prefix to the file name rather than append a suffix this should avoid confus diff/merg program that depend on the suffix to guess the type of the file content * we now set the keepal option on the server socket to make sure that the server time out if the communic link is unexpect broken * bug fix + when updat small file unison now close the destin file + file permiss are proper updat when the file is behind a follow link + sever other small fix chang sinc number * major window perform improv we'v ad a prefer fastcheck that make unison look onli at a file creation time and last-modifi time to check whether it has chang this should result in a huge speedup when check for updat in larg replica when this switch is set unison will use file creation time as pseudo inod number when scan window replica for updat instead of read the full content of everi file this may caus unison to miss propag an updat if the creat time modif time and length of the file are all unchang by the updat (this is not easi to achiev but it can be done) howev unison will never overwrit such an updat with a chang from the other replica sinc it alway doe a safe check for updat just befor propag a chang thus it is reason to use this switch most of the time and occasion run unison onc with fastcheck set to fals if you are worri that unison may have overlook an updat warn this chang is has not yet been thorough field-test if you set the fastcheck prefer pay care attent to what unison is do * new function central backup and merg + this version incorpor two piec of major new function implement by sylvain roy dure a summer internship at penn a central backup facil that keep a full backup of (select file in) each replica and a merg featur that allow unison to invok an extern file-merg tool to resolv conflict chang to individu file + central backup o unison now maintain full backup of the last-synchron version of (some of) the file in each replica these function both as backup in the usual sens and as the ``common version' when invok extern merg program o the back up file are store in a directori /.unison/backup on each host (the name of this directori can be chang by set the environ variabl unisonbackupdir.) o the predic backup control which file are actual back up give the prefer backup = path *' caus back up of all file o file are ad to the backup directori whenev unison updat it archiv this mean that # when unison reconstruct it archiv from scratch (e.g. becaus of an upgrad or becaus the archiv file have been manual deleted) all file will be back up # otherwis each file will be back up the first time unison propag an updat for it o the prefer backupvers control how mani previous version of each file are kept the default is number (i.e. the last synchron version plus one backup) o for backward compat the backup prefer is also still support but backup is now prefer o it is ok to manual delet file from the backup directori (or to throw away the directori itself) befor unison use ani of these file for anyth import it check that it fingerprint match the one that it expect + merg o both user interfac offer a new merg command invok by press m (with a chang file selected) o the actual merg is perform by an extern program the prefer merg and number control how this program is invok if a backup exist for this file (see the backup preference) then the merg prefer is use for this purpos otherwis number is use in both case the valu of the prefer should be a string repres the command that should be pass to a shell to invok the merg program within this string the special substr number number new and old may appear at ani point unison will substitut these as follow befor invok the command # number is replac by the name of the local copi of the file # number is replac by the name of a temporari file into which the content of the remot copi of the file have been transfer by unison prior to perform the merg # new is replac by the name of a temporari file that unison expect to be written by the merg program when it finish give the desir new content of the file and # old is replac by the name of the back up copi of the origin version of the file (i.e. it state at the end of the last success run of unison) if one exist (appli onli to merg not number for exampl on unix system set the merg prefer to merg = number -m number old number  new will tell unison to use the extern number program for merg a larg

(ediff-merge-files-with-ancestor number number "old" nil "new") (these command are display here on two line to avoid run off the edg of the page in your prefer file each should be written on a singl line.) o if the extern program exit without leav ani file at the path new unison consid the merg to have fail if the merg program write a file call new but exit with a non-zero status code then unison consid the merg to have succeed but to have generat conflict in this case it attempt to invok an extern editor so that the user can resolv the conflict the valu of the editor prefer control what editor is invok by unison the default is emac o pleas send us suggest for other use valu of the number and merg prefer -- we'd like to give sever exampl in the manual * smaller chang + when one prefer file includ anoth unison no longer add the suffix .prf to the includ file by default if a file with precis the given name exist in the .unison directori it will be use otherwis unison will add .prf as it did befor (this chang mean that includ prefer file can be name blah.includ instead of blah.prf so that unison will not offer them in it choos a prefer file dialog.) + for linux system we now offer both a static link and a dynam link execut the static one is larger but will probabl run on more system sinc it doesn't depend on the same version of dynam link librari modul be avail + fix the forc and prefer prefer which were get the propag direct exact backward + fix a bug in the startup code that would caus unison to crash when the default profil (~/.unison/default.prf) doe not exist + fix a bug where on the run when a profil is first creat unison would confus display the root in revers order in the user interfac * for develop + we'v ad a modul depend diagram to the sourc distribut in src/dependencies.p to help new prospect develop with navig the code chang sinc number * incompat chang archiv format has chang * incompat chang the startup sequenc has been complet rewritten and great simplifi the main user-vis chang is that the defaultpath prefer has been remov it effect can be approxim by use multipl profil with includ direct to incorpor common set all use of defaultpath in exist profil should be chang to path anoth chang in startup behavior that will affect some user is that it is no longer possibl to specifi root both in the profil and on the command line you can achiev a similar effect though by break your profil into two default.prf = root = blah root = foo includ common common.prf =   now do unison common number number when you want to specifi root explicit * the -prefer and -forc option have been extend to allow user to specifi that file with more recent modtim should be propag write either -prefer newer or -forc newer (for symmetri unison will also accept -prefer older or -forc older.) the -forc older/new option can onli be use when -time is also set the graphic user interfac provid access to these facil on a one-off basi via the action menu * name of root can now be ``aliased' to allow replica to be reloc without chang the name of the archiv file where unison store inform between run (this featur is for expert onli see the ``archiv files' section of the manual for more information.) * graphic user-interfac + a new command is provid in the synchron menu for switch to a new profil without restart unison from scratch + the gui also support one-key shortcut for common use profil if a profil contain a prefer of the form key = n' where n is a singl digit then press this key will caus unison to immedi switch to this profil and begin synchron again from scratch (ani action that may have been select for a set of chang current be display will be discarded.) + each profil may includ a prefer label =  give a descript string that describ the option select in this profil the string is list along with the profil name in the profil select dialog and display in the top-right corner of the main unison window * minor + fix a bug that would sometim caus the diff display to order the file backward relat to the main user interfac (thank to pascal brisset for this fix.) + on unix system the graphic version of unison will check the display variabl and if it is not set automat fall back to the textual user interfac + synchron path (path preferences) are now match against the ignor prefer so if a path is both specifi in a path prefer and ignor it will be skip + numer other bugfix and small improv chang sinc number * the synchron of modif time has been disabl for directori * prefer file may now includ line of the form includ  which will caus name.prf to be read at that point * the synchron of permiss between window and unix now work proper * a bind cygwin=binmod in now ad to the environ so that the cygwin port of openssh work proper in a non-cygwin context * the servercmd and addversionno prefer can now be use togeth -addversionno append an appropri -nnn to the server command which is found by use the valu of the -servercmd prefer if there is one or els just unison * both -pref=val and -pref val are now allow for boolean valu (the former can be use to set a prefer to false.) * lot of small bug fix chang sinc number * the log prefer is now set to true by default sinc the log file seem use for most user * sever miscellan bugfix (most involv symlinks) chang sinc number * incompat chang archiv format has chang (again) * sever signific bug introduc in number have been fix chang sinc number * incompat chang archiv format has chang make sure you synchron your replica befor upgrad to avoid spurious conflict the first sync after upgrad will be slow * new function + unison now synchron file modtim user-id and group-id these new featur are control by a set of new prefer all of which are current fals by default o when the time prefer is set to true file modif time are propag (becaus the represent of time may not have the same granular on both replica unison may not alway be abl to make the modtim precis equal but it will get them as close as the oper system involv allow.) o when the owner prefer is set to true file ownership inform is synchron o when the group prefer is set to true group inform is synchron o when the numericid prefer is set to true owner and group inform is synchron numer by default owner and group number are convert to name on each replica and these name are synchron (the special user id number and the special group number are never map via user/group name even if this prefer is not set.) + ad an integer-valu prefer perm that can be use to control the propag of permiss bit the valu of this prefer is a mask indic which permiss bit should be synchron it is set by default to number all bit but the set-uid and set-gid bit are synchronis (synchron these latter bit can be a secur hazard) if you want to synchron all bit you can set the valu of this prefer to number + ad a log prefer (default false) which make unison keep a complet record of the chang it make to the replica by default this record is written to a file call unison.log in the user home directori (the valu of the home environ variable) if you want it someplac els set the logfil prefer to the full pathnam you want unison to use + ad an ignorenot prefer that maintain a set of pattern for path that should definit not be ignor whether or not they match an ignor pattern (that is a path will now be ignor iff it match an ignor pattern and doe not match ani ignorenot patterns.) * user-interfac improv + root are now display in the user interfac in the same order as they were given on the command line or in the prefer file + when the batch prefer is set the graphic user interfac no longer wait for user confirm when it display a warn messag it simpli pop up an advisori window with a dismiss button at the bottom and keep on go + ad a new prefer for control how mani status messag are print dure updat detect statusdepth control the maximum depth for path on the local machin (longer path are not display nor are non-directori paths) the valu should be an integ default is number + remov the trace and silent prefer they did not seem veri use and there were too mani prefer for control output in various way + the text ui now display just the default command (the one that will be use if the user just type  instead of all avail command type  will print the full list of possibl + the function that find the canon hostnam of the local host (which is use for exampl in calcul the name of the archiv file use to rememb which file have been synchronized) normal use the gethostnam oper system call howev if the environ variabl unisonlocalhostnam is set it valu will now be use instead this make it easier to use unison in situat where a machin name chang frequent (e.g. becaus it is a laptop and get move around a lot) + file owner and group are now display in the ``detail window' at the bottom of the screen when unison is configur to synchron them * for hacker + updat to jacqu garrigu new version of lablgtk which mean we can throw away our local patch version if you'r compil the gtk version of unison from sourc you'll need to updat your copi of lablgtk to the develop releas avail from URL (warn instal lablgtk under window is current a bit challenging.) + the todo.txt file (in the sourc distribution) has been clean up and reorgan the list of pend task should be much easier to make sens of for peopl that may want to contribut their program energi there is also a separ file bugs.txt for open bug + the tk user interfac has been remov (it was not be maintain and no longer compiles) + the debug prefer now print quit a bit of addit inform that should be use for identifi sourc of problem + the version number of the remot server is now check right away dure the connect setup handshak rather than later (somebodi sent a bug report of a server crash that turn out to come from use inconsist version better to check this earlier and in a way that can't crash either client or server.) + unison now run correct on number architectur (e.g alpha linux) we will not be distribut binari for these architectur ourselv (at least for a while) but if someon would like to make them avail we'll be glad to provid a link to them * bug fix + pattern match (e.g for ignore) is now case-insensit when unison is in case-insensit mode (i.e. when one of the replica is on a window machine) + some peopl had troubl with mysteri failur dure propag of updat where file would be fals report as have chang dure synchron this should be fix + numer smaller fix chang sinc number * ad a number of sort mode for the user interfac by default conflict chang are display at the top and the rest of the entri are sort in alphabet order this behavior can be chang in the follow way + set the sortnewfirst prefer to true caus newli creat file to be display befor chang file + set sortbys caus file to be display in increas order of size + give the prefer  (where  is a path descriptor in the same format as ignor and follow pattern caus path match this pattern to be display first + similar give the prefer  caus path match this pattern to be display last the sort prefer are describ in more detail in the user manual the sortnewfirst and sortbys flag can also be access from the sort menu in the grpahic user interfac * ad two new prefer that can be use to chang unison fundament behavior to make it more like a mirror tool instead of a synchron + give the prefer prefer with argument  (bi ad -prefer  to the command line or  to your profile) mean that if there is a conflict the content of  should be propag to the other replica (with no question asked) non-conflict chang are treat as usual + give the prefer forc with argument  will make unison resolv all differ in favor of the given root even if it was the other replica that was chang these option should be use with care (more inform is avail in the manual.) * small chang + chang default answer to yes in all two-button dialog in the graphic interfac (this seem more intuitive) + the rsync prefer has been remov (it was use to activ rsync compress for file transfer but rsync compress is now enabl by default) + in the text user interfac the arrow indic which direct chang are be propag are print differ when the user has overrid unison default recommend  instead of  this match the behavior of the graphic interfac which display such arrow in a differ color + carriag return (control-m's) are ignor at the end of line in profil for window compat + all prefer are now fulli document in the user manual chang sinc number * incompat chang archiv format has chang make sure you synchron your replica befor upgrad to avoid spurious conflict the first sync after upgrad will be slow * new/improv function + a new prefer -sortbys control the order in which chang are display to the user when it is set to true the smallest chang file are display first (the default set is false.) + a new prefer -sortnewfirst caus newli creat file to be list befor other updat in the user interfac + we now allow the ssh protocol to specifi a port + incompat chang the unison protocol is deprec and we ad file and socket: you may have to modifi your profil in the .unison directori if a replica is specifi without an explicit protocol we now assum it refer to a file (previous "//saul/foo" meant to use ssh to connect to saul then access the foo directori now it mean to access saul via a remot file mechan such as samba the old effect is now achiev by write ssh://saul/foo.) + chang the startup sequenc for the case where root are given but no profil is given on the command line the new behavior is to use the default profil (creat it if it doe not exist) and temporarili overrid it root the manual claim that this case would work by read no profil at all but afaik this was never true + in all user interfac file with conflict are alway list first + a new prefer sshversion can be use to control which version of ssh should be use to connect to the server legal valu are number and number (default is empti which will make unison use whatev version of ssh is instal as the default ssh command.) + the situat when the permiss of a file was updat the same on both side is now handl correct (we use to report a spurious conflict) * improv for the window version + the fact that filenam are treat case-insensit under window should now be handl correct the exact behavior is describ in the cross-platform section of the manual + it should be possibl to synchron with window share e.g. //host/drive/path + workaround to the bug in sync root directori in window the most difficult thing to fix is an ocaml bug unix.opendir fail on c in some version of window * improv to the gtk user interfac (the tk interfac is no longer be maintained) + the ui now display action differ (in blue) when they have been explicit chang by the user from unison default recommend + more color appear + the initi profil select window work better + if ani transfer fail a messag to this effect is display along with synchron complet at the end of the transfer phase (in case they may have scroll off the top) + ad a global progress meter display the percentag of total byte that have been transfer so far * improv to the text user interfac + the file detail will be display automat when a conflict is been detect + when a warn is generat (e.g for a temporari file left over from a previous run of unison) unison will no longer wait for a respons if it is run in -batch mode + the ui now display a short list of possibl input each time it wait for user interact + the ui now quit immedi (rather than loop back and start the interact again) if the user press q when ask whether to propag chang + press g in the text user interfac will proceed immedi with propag updat without ask ani more question * document and instal chang + the manual now includ a faq plus section on common problem and on trick contribut by user + both the download page and the download directori explicit say what are the current stabl and beta-test version number + the ocaml sourc for the up-to-the-minut develop version (not guarante to be stabl or even to compil at ani given time!) are now avail from the download page + ad a subsect to the manual describ cross-platform issu (case conflict illeg filenames) * mani small bug fix and random improv chang sinc number * sever bug fix the most import is a bug in the rsync modul that would occasion caus chang propag to fail with a renam error chang sinc number * the multi-thread transport system is now disabl by default (it is not stabl enough yet.) * various bug fix * a new experiment featur the final compon of a -path argument may now be the wildcard specifi * when unison see such a path it expand this path on the client into into the correspond list of path by list the content of that directori note that if you use wildcard path from the command line you will probabl need to use quot or a backslash to prevent the * from be interpret by your shell if both root are local the content of the first one will be use for expand wildcard path (nb this is the first one after the canon step -- i.e. the one that is list first in the user interfac -- not the one list first on the command line or in the prefer file.) chang sinc number * the transport subsystem now includ an implement by sylvain gommier and norman ramsey of tridgel and mackerra rsync protocol this protocol achiev much faster transfer when onli a small part of a larg file has been chang by send just diff this featur is main help for transfer over slow links---on fast local area network it can actual degrad performance---so we have left it off by default start unison with the -rsync option (or put rsync=tru in your prefer file) to turn it on * ``progress bars' are now diplay dure remot file transfer show what percentag of each file has been transfer so far * the version number scheme has chang new releas will now be have number like number where the second compon is increment on everi signific public releas and the third compon is the ``patch level.' * miscellan improv to the gtk-base user interfac * the manual is now avail in pdf format * we are experi with use a multi-thread transport subsystem to transfer sever file at the same time make much more effect use of avail network bandwidth this featur is not complet stabl yet so by default it is disabl in the releas version of unison if you want to play with the multi-thread version you'll need to recompil unison from sourc (as describ in the documentation) set the thread flag in makefile.ocaml to true make sure that your ocaml compil has been instal with the -with-pthread configur option (you can verifi this by check whether the file threads/threads.cma in the ocaml standard librari directori contain the string -lpthread near the end.) chang sinc number * reduc memori footprint (this is especi import dure the first run of unison where it has to gather inform about all the file in both repositories) * fix a bug that would caus the socket server under nt to fail after the client exit * ad a shift modifi to the ignor menu shortcut key in gtk interfac (to avoid hit them accidentally) chang sinc number * tunnel over ssh is now support in the window version see the instal section of the manual for detail instruct * the transport subsystem now includ an implement of the rsync protocol built by sylvain gommier and norman ramsey this protocol achiev much faster transfer when onli a small part of a larg file has been chang by send just diff the rsync featur is off by default in the current version use the -rsync switch to turn it on (nb we still have a lot of tune to do you may not notic much speedup yet.) * we'r experi with a multi-thread transport subsystem written by jerom vouillon the download binari are still single-thread if you want to tri the multi-thread version you'll need to recompil from sourc (say make threads=true.) nativ thread support from the compil is requir use the option -thread n to select the maxim number of concurr thread (default is number multi-thread and single-thread clients/serv can interoper * a new gtk-base user interfac is now avail thank to jacqu garrigu the tk user interfac still work but we'll be shift develop effort to the gtk interfac from now on * ocaml number is now requir for compil unison from sourc the modul uitk and myfileselect have been chang to use labltk instead of camltk to compil the tk interfac in window you must have number and number when instal number put it in c:\tcl rather than the suggest c:\program files\tcl and be sure to instal the header and librari (which are not instal by default) * ad a new -addversionno switch which caus unison to use  instead of just unison as the remot server command this allow multipl version of unison to coexist conveni on the same server whichev version is run on the client the same version will be select on the server chang sinc number * incompat chang archiv format has chang make sure you synchron your replica befor upgrad to avoid spurious conflict the first sync after upgrad will be slow * this version fix sever annoy bug includ + some case where propag of file permiss was not work + umask is now ignor when creat directori + directori are creat writabl so that a read-on directori and it content can be propag + handl of warn generat by the server + synchron a path whose parent is not a directori on both side is now flag as erron + fix some bug relat to symnbol link and nonexist root o when a chang (delet or new contents) is propag onto a follow' symlink the file point to by the link is now chang (we use to chang the link itself which doesn't fit our assert that follow mean the link is complet invisible) o when one root did not exist propag the other root on top of it use to fail becuas unison could not calcul the work directori into which to write chang this should be fix * a human-read timestamp has been ad to unison archiv file * the semant of path and name regular express now correspond better * some minor improv to the text ui (e.g a command for go back to previous items) * the organ of the export directori has chang --- should be easier to find / download thing now chang sinc number * incompat chang archiv format has chang make sure you synchron your replica befor upgrad to avoid spurious conflict the first sync after upgrad will be slow * this version has not been test extens on window * major intern chang design to make unison safer to run at the same time as the replica are be chang by the user * intern perform improv chang sinc number * incompat chang archiv format has chang make sure you synchron your replica befor upgrad to avoid spurious conflict the first sync after upgrad will be slow * a number of intern function have been chang to reduc the amount of memori alloc especi dure the first synchron this should help power user with veri big replica * reimplement of low-level remot procedur call stuff in prepar for ad rsync-lik smart file transfer in a later releas * miscellan bug fix chang sinc number * incompat chang archiv format has chang make sure you synchron your replica befor upgrad to avoid spurious conflict the first sync after upgrad will be slow * fix some small bug in the interpret of ignor pattern * fix some problem that were prevent the window version from work correct when click-start * fix to treatment of file permiss under window which were caus spurious report of differ permiss when synchron between window and unix system * fix one more non-tail-recurs list process function which was caus stack overflow when synchron veri larg replica chang sinc number * the text user interfac now provid command for ignor file * we found and fix some more non-tail-recurs list process function some power user have report success with veri larg replica * incompat chang file end in .tmp are no longer ignor automat if you want to ignor such file put an appropri ignor pattern in your profil * incompat chang the syntax of ignor and follow pattern has chang instead of put a line of the form ignor =  in your profil (.unison/default.prf) you should put ignor = regexp  moreov two other style of pattern are also recogn ignor = name  match ani path in which one compon match  while ignor = path  match exact the path  standard ``globbing' convent can be use in  and  + a  match ani singl charact except / + a * match ani sequenc of charact not includ / + [xyz] match ani charact from the set {x y z } + {a,bb,ccc} match ani one of a bb or ccc see the user manual for some exampl chang sinc number * some user were report stack overflow when synchron huge directori we found and fix some non-tail-recurs list process function which we hope will solv the problem pleas give it a tri and let us know * major addit to the document chang sinc number * major intern tidi and mani small bugfix * major addit to the user manual * unison can now be start with no argument -- it will prompt automat for the name of a profil file contain the root to be synchron this make it possibl to start the graphic ui from a desktop icon * fix a small bug where the text ui on nt was rais a no such signal except chang sinc number * the precompil window binari in the last releas was compil with an old ocaml compil caus propag of permiss not to work (and perhap lead to some other strang behavior we'v heard report about) this has been correct if you'r use precompil binari on window pleas upgrad * ad a -debug command line flag which control debug of various modul say -debug xxx to enabl debug trace for modul xxx or -debug all to turn on absolut everyth * fix a small bug where the text ui on nt was rais a no such signal except chang sinc number * incompat chang the name and format of the prefer file in the .unison directori have chang in particular + the file ``prefs' should be renam to default.prf + the content of the file ``ignore' should be merg into default.prf each line of the form regexp in ignor should becom a line of the form ignor = regexp in default.prf * unison now handl permiss bit and symbol link see the manual for detail * you can now have differ prefer file in your .unison directori if you start unison like this unison profilenam (i.e with just one ``anonymous' command-lin argument) then the file ~/.unison/profilename.prf will be load instead of default.prf * some improv to termin handl in the text user interfac * ad a switch -killserv that termin the remot server process when the unison client is shut down even when use socket for communic (bi default a remot server creat use ssh/rsh is termin automat while a socket server is left running.) * when start in socket server mode unison print server start on stderr when it is readi to accept connect (this may be use for script that want to tell when a socket-mod server has finish initalization.) * we now make a night mirror of our current intern develop tree in case anyon want an up-to-the-minut version to hack around with * ad a file contrib with some suggest for how to help us make unison better to
