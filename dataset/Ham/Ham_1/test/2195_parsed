 onc upon a time daniel wrote    and yes i accept patches/comments/suggest about all those spec   file   sure thing :) cool :-)  i'v ad to the spec some flag to remov oss and isa-pnp support at  build time if one wish to so is possibl to do a   rpmbuild --recompil  --without oss --without isapnp ok i'll add this  also have the kernel compil by me i have no kernel-sourc packag  instal i'v ad a flag "kernsrc" that also can be use  --without to remov the depend for kernel-sourc at build time it  would be nice to check the correct kernel includ file actual exist  (/lib/modules/`unam -r`/build/include/linux/*.h) though howev i'm  a beginn in rpm build -- is it possibl to buildrequir for a file  not provid by a packag at all i'v googl a bit and found no way  to do that requir a file that isn't part of an rpm is not possibl no except mayb by stop the build process if it isn't found.. but that errr.. ugli and i realli think that for peopl who instal a kernel from sourc the easiest is to instal the alsa kernel driver from sourc too..  i was also consid ad some sort of flag for the --with-card  option in alsa ./configur but don't know how to do that onli found  out about --without from your first alsa-driver.spec and exist rpm  doc don't help much this would be a tricki one sinc to use the "--with  featur of rpmbuild i think you'd need to add individu handl of each and everi card :-/  oh and one more thing :) at first i'v instal the first version of  alsa-driv for number although i don't have that kernel to suppli  the depend for the rest of the alsa rpm and compil the modul  from sourc it creat the /dev file and all that what the "alsa-driver" is there for creat all the base file exclud the kernel driver what i would suggest for depend reason it to instal an "alsa-kernel" for the origin kernel (you'v kept it right ;-)) and instal alsa modul from sourc for custom kernel built from sourc  then want to make my own rpm for number so now i'm tri to rpmbuild  the alsa-kernel packag remov all alsa rpms and tri my spec   rpmbuild --ba alsa-driver.spec.min --without oss --without isapnp  --without kernsrc   but i get this   ==[long success compil snipped]=====================================  rpm build error  file list twice /dev/adsp  file list twice /dev/amidi  instal (but unpackaged) file(s) found  number  /etc/rc.d/init.d/alsasound  ========================================================================   oh and i think i'v forgot to mention i'm run beta-nul :) inde  the rpm number snapshot in (null) has a few new featur among which have the build fail when file are present in the build root but not list in the percent section i should remov them manual as part of the build process.. or mayb the new percent /path/to/file" in the percent section would do but i don't know how older version of rpm would handl it on my (null) build system i'v simpli set the variabl  percent number matthia -- matthia saou world trade center ------------- edificio nort number planta system and network engin number barcelona spain electron group interact phone  number number number number number _______________________________________________ rpm-list mail list email URL
