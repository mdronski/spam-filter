 url number date number _joe gregorio_ my next pet number number to re-creat the "good number on a window number i have also made half-heart attempt in this direct as i am forc to use window dure the day i say half-heart becaus i'm still application-centr and i don't go as far with keyboard shortcut as i could but i don't use the desktop at all (never have on ani system) and i don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcut becaus i person find them awkward (ymmv) if you must use window the first step toward a product system is manag your start menu i use the main level of the start menu with number shortcut to my most common program number control number number number number number number dos home" number dos work" number dos incoming" (each of which give me a command line but in differ directories) number number number ie" also "# explor home" dollar explor work" percent explor incoming" which open explor window in various use directori (the same directori as the dos shortcut onli with the shift key held down and yes i intent set it up so that dollar went to my work folder) less-us program are taken out of their useless submenus (as installed) and move direct into the program submenu and given uniqu first letter as need number number "im" "netscap number "paint shop pro" "queri tool number number number all other submenus except startup are remov from the program menu (ye delet "accessories" do you honest ever use it if so it probabl a sign of a larger product problem.) thing which never need to be run manual (like winzip and quicktime) are remov from the program menu maintain a clean program menu is an ongo struggl but well worth it on most modern keyboard there is a key next to your left alt key that open the start menu which you can press with your left thumb without take your finger off the home key otherwis ctrl esc alway work menu number give me a new command prompt in my work directori menu p n run netscap number (for compat test in my day job ugh) mozilla and emac are almost alway open but i quit lesser-us applic as soon as i'm done use them (most becaus my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory) i instal number so that the command line is actual use cygwin is a collect of window port of all your favorit unix util includ mv cp scp ssh man tar less grep patch ncftp cvs and mani other and bash which i don't use becaus i dislik how it handl window pathnam i also set the properti of my command line shortcut to set the window size to number x number (almost full screen at number x number and screen buffer size to number x number set window posit at number x number and don't let the system posit the window in mozilla i set my home page to "about:blank" set internet search to search with googl use tab brows open tab instead of window in all possibl case alway show the tab bar and load link in the background (essenti for weblog surf you can ctrl click link to open them in new tab in the background) under script & plugin i do not allow script to open unrequest window i turn off the sidebar turn on the site navig bar delet all pre-instal bookmark and creat two bookmark one which take me to my webmail and anoth which take me to my intern site number from which i can find all other bookmark i need in internet explor i set my home page to the page to edit my weblog sinc that the onli thing i do in internet explor alt tab back and forth between mozilla and ie is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tab within mozilla sinc textarea in mozilla lose focus when you switch tab make copi and past weblog entri virtual imposs i use emac local and vi remot becaus the default behavior of emac is so heinous as to render it unus (for instanc edit a cgi script name foo.cgi on a web server with emac would generat a foo.cgi~ backup file which is world-read and is sent as plain text to ani browser that ask tri this sometim on your favorit web site.) among other thing my .emac file (which is actual call _emac on windows) instruct emac to store all backup file in a singl directori (d:\backup) to treat all xml file as docbook all cgi script as python and all sql script as pl/sql to use cygwin bash shell for m-x-shell to use a singl maxim frame with no menubar titl as the name of the current file to show column number to accept "y" and "n" for yes/no question not to blink not to beep and to close the current file when i press m-w i use some weird registri hack and a hack notepad.ex to get all text file to open in emac (i got this idea from number my _emac file is my second most backed-up possess i don't use window useless directori structur for user home directori on my d drive i have d:\home (contain directori for my book and other person project each under cvs number set as my home directori use the home environ variable) d:\work (contain directori for each work project also under cvs) d:\incom (set as default download directori for all program that download things) and d:\backup (use by emac and for temporari storag for instanc for store origin when check out newli creat cvs projects) i don't know or care what where on my c drive i have tri mani mani address book and still store all my contact email address snail mail address phone number and other vital person inform in a text file call phone store in d:\home\phon it is not in ani particular format other than be plain text and usual includ blank line between entri i categor peopl with simpl keyword in parenthes after their name and use m-x-occur in emac to search by keyword this file is my singl most backed-up possess other essenti free
