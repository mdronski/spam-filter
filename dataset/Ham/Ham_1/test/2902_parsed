 dan kohn email write  guy the habea infring list (hil) exist explicit to deal with  spammer while we'r get judgment against them and especi in  other countri where those judgment are harder to get my concern doesn't stem from fail to understand how your busi is intend to work my concern is the lack of empir evid that it will reduc the amount of uncaught spam  pleas note that nobodi has ever had an incent befor to go after  regular spammer yes some attorney general have prosecut blatant  pyramid scheme and isp have won some theft of servic suit but  the vast major of spammer go forward with out ani legal hassl  so i can't understand how daniel can assert that you can't track  spammer down when it never realli been tri pleas don't misquot me i did not assert that you "can't track spammers" here is what i said  it will be difficult to find prosecut and win money from someon in  various non-friend countri where spam origin (china is a good  example) even if they do offici "respect" copyright law i understand the incent that you have to pursu spammer but that doe not direct translat to less spam be sent to my inbox it is an indirect effect and the magnitud of the effect may not be suffici to counteract the eas with which a number score on the mark allow spam to avoid be tag as spam  daniel it easi enough for you to chang the habea score yourself  on your instal if habea fail to live up to it promis to  onli licens the warrant mark to non-spamm and to place all  violat on the hil then i have no doubt that justin and craig will  quick remov us from the next releas but you'r tri to kill  habea befor it has a chanc to show ani promis i think i'v work on sa enough to understand that i can local a score i'm just not comfort with use spamassassin as a vehicl for drum up your busi at the expens of our user base i think it would make more sens to start habea with a less aggress score (one which will not give spammer a quick path into everyon inbox) and after we'v seen evid that the system work then we can increas the magnitud of the score dan ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsor by:thinkgeek welcom to geek heaven URL _______________________________________________ spamassassin-talk mail list email URL
