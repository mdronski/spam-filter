 on number number percent sep number number at number number eric nichol wrote  hello again i tri all the suggest for the pctel driver and at  the end of it everyth still goe smooth until i type "make"  after i get the output from the ./configur   howev there were a coupl of thing i notic along the way after type  * cp number .config  * make oldconfig  * make dep  the number to last line i got back said that the modversions.h file was  not updat when i look at this path to the modversions.h file it  was number line and everi line start with a # mark  is it the case  that noth is read on a line after a # mark (or am i just think  of anoth language?) and so should i delet the # at certain place no that is appropri content for the file i'm not a c programm but i think that these sort of thing (#includ  are instruct to the compil process by a pre-processor in the compil process and includ all sort of symbols/funct e.g "#includ  give you math type function sinc they start with "#" they are ignor in the final compil regard the rest of the compil process you need to tell the pctel softwar to look in the right place for the kernel headers/sourc i recal from your previous mail that there was a flag number which could be pass to the ./configur script (with the appropri directori in place of number this might allow you to persuad the code to compil against the correct header i think this is the right way to proceed altern mayb the step abov regard "make dep" and so forth should have been perform in the directori where the make process is look for modversions.h & co i don't think it is a good idea keep move file into the directori as you describ below first of all you will move modversions.h (which you have done) then you would have to move all those *.ver file after that there will almost certain be a need for further header (*.h) file this could be quick done but is probabl bad (those file don't realli belong there) for what it worth i think you are veri close to a success compil m   also when i was in the pctel directori and type "make" i notic  that a differ subdirectori is taken to a differ modversions.h  file insid this other file there noth at all and so i move  the modversions.h file with number line to the empti modversions.h file  - and got a differ repli after "make" the output after i move the  file over most look like this  number  linux/modules/adb.v no such file or directori  number  number no such file or directori  number  linux/modules/af_ipx.v no such file or directori   the odd line be the path and the first half of the other line are  what written after the # in the modversions.h file should there be  a file at each of these (one at each of the number line of the file)  that i'd have to compile/mak -- michael conri number web URL key fingerprint = number number number number number number number number number number -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
