 on thu number at number matthia saou wrote  i didn't say it wasn't nice it look great but.. it clear doesn't suit  my need or tast   - i'm a sloppi focus addict.. and i configur sawfish to behav exact  like i want for window focus and delay rais as well as separ  window per desktop or place transient window for all these reason and  mani other metac that havoc pennington want to keep basic and simpl  is right out :-( one of the thing you need to understand with number is that while they did simplifi a lot of thing most of the configur option peopl found veri use are still avail through gconf learn to love gconf-editor ;) -- metac can have sloppi focus (desktop prefer  window focus -- there actual gui for that) and the delay until rais (and whether it raises) can be set in gconf-editor /apps/metacity/general/auto_rais and auto_raise_delay  - i like the abil to have slide panel that auto-hid in gnome.. but  with the new panel you can't specifi the amount of pixel by which it  stick out anymor :-( /apps/panel/global/panel_minimized_s   these are onli two exampl i could find more  each time i use gnome number  i'm quick irrit by a littl someth that suit me better in number well it definit is not the same as number some peopl will alway like gnome number better whatev suit your need  i'm not say that gnome number is bad poor conceiv or ugli it'll  probabl even get veri good critic from review that are use to window  or maco x where i also feel "limited" myself i think you need to understand that simplifi the configur option and the ui doe make it a lot easier to use for peopl who are either not use it all the time or are just start to use it the gnome team decid that advanc user who want to edit the kind of option you talk about are advanc enough to use gconf-editor person i'm fine with that becaus i don't find gconf-editor hard to use :) julian _______________________________________________ rpm-list mail list email URL
