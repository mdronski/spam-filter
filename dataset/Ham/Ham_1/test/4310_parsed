 on wed number at number gari lawrenc murphi wrote   and a java program due to the extens class librari will weigh  in at percent the number of line of the equival c program qed my typic java-to-c convers doesn't increas the line of code by more than percent and a fair portion of that is the implement of addit featur that drove us to do the convers in the first place some thing are substanti more succinct when written in c than in java c and most other matur languag have an endless collect of librari i person don't use anyth beyond the core librari of ani languag that much though on a tangent i find librari near useless for a great mani thing due primarili to the fact that most of them are so general that a given non-trivi api almost alway has a context in which it will function in a patholog manner code reus is wonder and all that but librari frequent make design trade-off that won't work for me even if they theoret do exact what i need unfortun it isn't particular easi nor doe it make a nice simpl api to design a librari that realli is optimiz to a wide rang of design case i'v built a small collect of flexibl psuedo-polymorph api over the year that i tend to use but it is a pretti ugli solut for code reus when you get right down to it -jame roger email
