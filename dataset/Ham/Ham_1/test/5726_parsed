 [neal pickett]  ..  if you can spare the memori you might get better perform in this  case use the pickl store sinc it onli has to go to disk onc (but  boy doe it ever go to disk!) i can't think of anyth obvious to  speed thing up onc it all load into memori though on my box the current system score about number msgs per second (start in memori of course) while that can be a drag while wait for one of my full test run to complet (one of those score a messag more than number time and train more than number times) i'v got no urg to do ani speed optim -- if i were use this for my own email i'd never notic the drag guido will bitch like hell about wait an extra second for his number batch to score but he the boss so he bitch about everyth   that profil territori and profil is exact the kind of  optim i just said i wasn't go to do :) i haven't profil yet but *suspect* there aren't ani egregi hot spot number of long word with high-bit charact is like over expens *when* it happen but it doesn't happen that often and as an approach to non-english languag it suck anyway (i.e. there no point speed someth that ought to be replac entirely)
