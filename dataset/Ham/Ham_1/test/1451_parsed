 look at my friend jonathan compani voxeo unless you'r go to run out and build a platform that execut voic xml code and can support imap etc then the easiest way to do this is to leverag voxeo servic you can start build on it for free and you will pay  number per minut for the pleasur of using/test the servic URL if you have about number to throw at the project then you can look at nuanc which has a platform that combin voicexml/vxml speech reco and the l&h speech synthes which will allow you to have your email read to you by stephen hawk tellm & bevoc have off-the-shelf servic that do this though but from my test they suck if i were to build this i'd spec a lightweight imap client and voicexml browser and dump them on voxeo howev you'll find this to be extrem slow and frustrat better to us a screen phone with a wap client -ian on wednesday juli number number at number pm mr fork wrote  i was talk to a friend today about voic applic - use a  phone to  get mail or info (other thing are possibl but that what we talk  about)  he run a mail server call x-mail (or something) and it has  a web ui  written with some php page i made the comment that rend an inbox  list with voxml (or whatev the latest thing is) would be  trivial & with  a littl play around you could do a simpl voic app to  monitor & admin  the mail server or you could actual get/send mail this way   the hard part is hook up to the phone system - how do i get a  phone to  hit a voic app server that hit the URL enabl mail server  he'd want to give this back as open sourc but there is no  correspond  open sourc voic server - or is there   i'v look at bevoc - it seem that number is toast - doe  anybodi know  how els this could be done   i'd love to see a digit answer machin with some speech  recognit  built-in that would proxi into a person comput for contact  list & mail  & whatnot i could call /my/ home phone and bounc out to the web or do  whatev without need a public avail voic server    URL URL
