    my feel of this is that we realli do not want to have a    ftoc_clearcurr but rather just a rescanlin and the caller had    better know the line or msgid that routin shoud just put in the +    if the line/msg in question happen to be the cur msg thought     intuit that sound right to me it doe also call "tag remove" so   you'll have to make sure that get set correct as well     i think ani chang that make it behav more intuit are a good thing even   if they mean we have someth els to fix of cours that attitud is whi   i'v been fix exmh bug for number week  i have a version that work now i'll tri it a coupl of day and check it dure daylight basic i ad an agument to clearcurr and updat all caller to slap in dollar i also flip the order in msg_chang to clearcurr dollar after the mh_setcur for some reason it barf when mark mani messag unread i'll check that tomorrow g'night /ander _______________________________________________ exmh-work mail list email URL
