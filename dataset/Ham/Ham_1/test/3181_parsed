 i did someth crude along those line for vms vax mayb number year ago there is at least one product that doe it for pc though i don't recal it name it is also handi for case where you have a cd imag of some filesystem (or some other imag of a filesystem) that is intrins readon but whose filesystem will not accept (or is not graceful) readon storag it is also more or less necessari if you want to work with worm file structur which are older still there have been a number of filesystem for those date back to the earli number if not befor a generic facil of the type you mention is also one way to implement snapshot on top of an exist filesystem the written inform must (obviously!) be seekabl so you can provid the illus that you wrote to the storag a devic level implement is howev perfect adequ it doe not of cours distinguish for you what should have been chang and what should not if you truli know a devic (or perhap a partition) must not be written it can be simpler to either return error on write or to just return a fake success on write yet discard the data (ntfs live with the latter strategi just fine from my experi i have not tri it on number or reiser.) btw think about your mention of raid and consid the complex of write to number or number i would contend that with cheaper storag these day it make littl sens to use raid save for shadow and possibl stripe those at least do not have the complex and slowup danger that higher raid level have and there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a singl disk may hold number gig and up whi not dedic anoth whole disk to fault recoveri and lose the complex and slow write (sometimes) of raid glenn everhart -----origin message----- from email email sent tuesday septemb number number number pm to webappsec securityfocus.com secprog securityfocus subject use of base imag / delta imag for autom recoveri from attack hi i was inspir by a mode of oper support by vmware you can have a base disk imag share by multipl virtual machin (vm) instanc that base imag is never alter by a vm instanc instead each vm instanc write chang to it own "redo" log futur hard disk read from that vm instanc incorpor both the base imag and the appropri redo log to present the current disk imag for that specif virtual machin this is describ here (thank to duan for provid this link on the honeypot mail list) URL could this basic concept be use to easili make self-fix client/serv applic that effici and automat recov from most attack even befor those attack have been discov here is what i imagin the physic architectur of most product client/serv system are layer for exampl your basic web applic might have a web server run apach connect to an applic server run some number or .net busi logic connect to a databas server for persist the onli one of these whose disk imag realli should evolv over time is the databas server and even here you often put the static rdbms softwar on one partit and the changeabl datafil on anoth partit it is onli the partit with the volatil datafil that must be allow to chang from one boot to the next other parit may need to be writabl for say swap space but these chang could be elimin on each reboot when someon crack this system they will probabl chang an imag that shouldn't be chang e.g. they might leverag a buffer overflow in ii or apach to instal a trojan or a backdoor on the more expos web server but what if the web server ran off a base imag write chang to a "delta" or "redo" partit and then what if everi night it automat eras the redo partit and reboot the downtim involv for each machin would be minim becaus it is onli delet data - rather than restor from backup in a system with redund web server for load balanc or high avail this could be schedul in a way such that the system is alway access this base/redo partit concept could be implement at the same level as a featur of hardwar raid allow for greater perform reliabl and hack resist this concept could also be appli to the applic server and even the databas server partit (except for those partit which contain the tabl data file of course.) doe anyon do this alreadi or is this a new concept or has this concept been discuss befor and abandon for some reason that i don't yet know i use the physic architectur of a basic web applic as an exampl in this post but this concept could of cours be appli to most server system it would allow for the hardware-separ of volatil and non-volatil disk imag it would be analog to perform night ghost oper onli it would be more effici and involv less (or no) downtim thank for ani opinion ben ********************************************************************** this transmiss may contain inform that is privileg confidenti and/or exempt from disclosur under applic law if you are not the intend recipi you are herebi notifi that ani disclosur copi distribut or use of the inform contain herein (includ ani relianc thereon) is strict prohibit if you receiv this transmiss in error pleas immedi contact the sender and destroy the materi in it entireti whether in electron or hard copi format thank you **********************************************************************
