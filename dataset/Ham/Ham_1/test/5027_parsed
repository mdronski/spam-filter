you report (libasound.so and wrong xine dependency) are now  fix in the current packag   oh it mayb also worth point out  i'v implement at last sort  by both last chang date and alphabet for my "build list" in the php  code  URL   and yes i accept patches/comments/suggest about all those spec file sure thing :) i'v ad to the spec some flag to remov oss and isa-pnp support at build time if one wish to so is possibl to do a rpmbuild --recompil  --without oss --without isapnp (i haven't includ oss in my number becaus number on my motherboard is not support :( yet and i'm too lazi to recompil the kernel :)) also have the kernel compil by me i have no kernel-sourc packag instal i'v ad a flag "kernsrc" that also can be use --without to remov the depend for kernel-sourc at build time it would be nice to check the correct kernel includ file actual exist (/lib/modules/`unam -r`/build/include/linux/*.h) though howev i'm a beginn in rpm build -- is it possibl to buildrequir for a file not provid by a packag at all i'v googl a bit and found no way to do that i was also consid ad some sort of flag for the --with-card option in alsa ./configur but don't know how to do that onli found out about --without from your first alsa-driver.spec and exist rpm doc don't help much oh and one more thing :) at first i'v instal the first version of alsa-driv for number although i don't have that kernel to suppli the depend for the rest of the alsa rpm and compil the modul from sourc it creat the /dev file and all then want to make my own rpm for number so now i'm tri to rpmbuild the alsa-kernel packag remov all alsa rpms and tri my spec rpmbuild --ba alsa-driver.spec.min --without oss --without isapnp --without kernsrc but i get this ==[long success compil

so i don't understand much of what go on here the number file is from the makedev rpm and alsasound was suppos to be instal by alsa-driv i think it is not in the filesystem anyway i'v look in number they are there in etc for number i think the part that doe it is this line in alsa-driver.spec cp -a percent percent and alsasound is instal by percent oh and i think i'v forgot to mention i'm run
