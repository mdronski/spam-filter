 on tue jul number number at number number or so it is rumour hereabout niall o broin thought  i'm instal warm standbi disk on a number of box these disk will be  the same size (sometim bigger) than the main disk the idea is that everi  night i'll rsync the partit on the main disk to the standbi disk so that  in the case of disast the first port of call befor the tape is the  standbi disk (we did consid run linux md raid on the disk but raid  give you no protect against slip of the finger)   so in the event of finger slip we can mount the relev partit and  retriev the banjax file in the case of a disk crash the plan is that  we'll put the standbi disk in place of the main disk and the workstat  will be back up asap then we can deal with replac the disk without the  pressur of a broken box on our back   howev i'm stump as to how to instal lilo on the backup disk let say  the master disk is /dev/hda and the backup disk is /dev/hdb lilo.conf  current look like this   boot = /dev/hda  change-rul  reset  read-on  menu-schem = wg:kw:wg:wg  number  prompt  timeout = number  messag = /boot/messag   imag = /boot/vmlinuz  label = linux  root = number  vga = number  initrd = /boot/initrd     there are a coupl more boot stanza but they'r not german as you can  see / is on number and /boot is on number so if for instanc i had  boot from a cd and want to re-instal lilo on this disk i'd do someth  like   mount number /mnt  mount number /mnt/boot  lilo -r /mnt   which is ok becaus i'm instal lilo on /dev/hda and i want it to boot  from /dev/hda so it'll plug in all the right number   howev in the case of the standbi disk i'll have to do someth like   mount number /mnt  mount number /mnt/boot  lilo -r /mnt   but i'm obvious go to have to do someth differ here becaus i  want to instal onto /dev/hdb in such a way that the disk will boot when it  becom /dev/hda after a disast (like the one i had this morn :-( -  shut the stabl door was on the to-do list but the bloodi hors decid  to do a bunk early) the machin alreadi has it spare disk - just hadn't  yet been use :-(   i thought perhap i should just do lilo -b /dev/hdb -r /mnt but i think  that -b is analog to the boot keyword in lilo.conf or will this just  work automag  i.e boot = /dev/hda tell lilo what number to poke  where and it figur out where the disk is from the -r  from the hard disk upgrad mini howto  number prepar lilo to boot the new disk (thank to rick master for help with this.) we'r assum that lilo is instal on the hard disk master boot record (mbr) this seem to be the most common configur you want to instal lilo on what present the second hard disk but will becom the first hard disk edit the file /new-disk/etc/lilo.conf as follow disk=/dev/hdb number # tell lilo to treat the second # disk as if it were the first # disk (bio id number boot=/dev/hdb # instal lilo on second hard # disk map=/new-disk/boot/map # locat of "map file" install=/new-disk/boot/boot.b # file to copi to hard disk # boot sector prompt # have lilo show "lilo boot:" # prompt number # boot default system after number # second (valu is in tenth of # seconds.) image=/new-disk/boot/vmlinuz # locat of linux kernel the # actual name may includ a version # number for exampl # number label=linux # label for linux system number # locat of root partit on # new hard disk modifi this as # appropri for your system # note that you must use the name # of the futur locat onc the # old disk has been remov read-on # mount partit read-on at # first to run fsck conor ps um what doe  menu-schem = wg:kw:wg:wg do -- conor dali email domest sysadmin :-) --------------------- faenor.cod.i number up number day number number user load averag number number number hobbiton.cod.i number up number day number min number user load averag number number number -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
