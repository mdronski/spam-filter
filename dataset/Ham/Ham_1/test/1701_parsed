advertis that are deem  thin veil campaign contribut by some arbitrari  govern board as it was post to "discussion" i  thought there'd be some  instead it a post-gazett column by brian o'neil  lament the fact that some peopl know how to  fill out a permit so that they can take advantag  of their right to peaceabl assembl obvious  he poke fun at the idea that specif group  get specif "zones" and that it not up to the  polic to decid what messag and sign get put into  what zone to most expedi keep order oh that right greg becaus was explicit clear that the pro-bush folk went out and did the permit danc so where in the articl is this again let get someth straight here this -is- a first amend issu public street provid one isn't block traffic general tend to be sorta ok at least from my last interpret of con law a few year ago (i'll feign ignor wrt the fact that law may have chang and the specif fact in this case are weak) if this guy _was_ mere hold a sign (which it seem was the case for all the pro-bush folks) he did noth wrong he certain didn't do enough of a wrong to warrant a disord conduct charg i'll play with your perspect though let assum a few thing if i walk into the citi offic and tell them i want to peacabl assembl against bush do you think they'll give me a permit probabl not so i lie then the cop doe what happen in this scenario he walk up check my permit and find out that i falsifi my statement to get this said document he arrest me end of stori  the problem is that polit have gotten so muddi  nowaday that shout down and unpeac disrupt  polit ralli that you don't agre with has becom  common practic the court have constant rule  that there are some restrict on the first amend  they teach you that your veri first year of law school i'll agre with owen on this one muddi my ass how hard is it to chose between a republocrat or a demipublican not veri shout down has grown to becom the answer becaus the govern over a span of year and with the help of the court -has- limit the right we have as citizen under the first amend if you question the polici about terror or drug or iraq or bush in general you'r aid terror if you challeng the belief of the folk attend the various shadowi number confer you'r an anarchist and you'r herd off to a design protest spot mile away from anyth part of the point of speech is to be -heard- i can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewher and while that speech it not effect speech peopl are scream and shout over the polit figur becaus they cannot be heard in ani other way  i think that given the inform as laid out by the stori  mr o'neil has confus free speech with action free  speech or even protect speech as practic by almost  everi american seem to involv the abil to communic  an idea to an unknown audienc action involv direct  a specif comment to a specif well-defin individu or audienc  that has immedi harm and sometim physic  effect that is easili forseeabl by ani reason person get back to my origin point how do you communic an idea to an unknown audienc if you'r mile from where the audienc is how do you bypass the rule for be -miles- away from the audienc without violat the rule of the regim i don't think mr nell was throw pie at bush a sign the last time i check didn't caus physic injuri or even emot harm if i rememb cohen v california number u. number number it not the individu speak that has the requir to desist but the individu listen who has the option to leav just my number while it still consid legal -- best regard bitbitch email
