 nfs as a protocol is not known for it speedi but this is absurd i did an nfs instal of a box this morn (that would be the box which won't boot from cd for those who were in irc) and it was rather slow but i just left it to it have got it up i want to copi the dvd to a disk on it so i have it handi for instal ani further bit i might requir so i simpli mount the nfs export dvd on the new box and start copi after a coupl of minut i look - it was transfer about number a minut so i kill that and use rsync instead which is tick away now at about number mb/min - still not exact turbo charg but a lot better than the nfs rate ani idea as to what make it so slow  there realli no point in run more nfsd process as there is exact one client so i'm a littl at a loss i must say niall -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
