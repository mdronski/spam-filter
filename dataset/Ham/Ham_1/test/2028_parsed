these extraordinari measur much less present it to the public and that the bush administr appear to be against american-styl justic the default explan for govern secreci is to conceal offici wrongdo the administr is here make the case that american don't even have a right to question govern secreci we may find that the histori of this past year has been an epic loot from the public made possibl by the urgenc of react to number email after sept number a legal battl over limit of civil liberti august number number by the new york time this articl was report and written by adam liptak neil a lewi and benjamin weiser in the fear aftermath of sept number attorney general john ashcroft vow to use the full might of the feder govern and "everi avail statute" to hunt down and punish "the terrorist among us." the roundup that follow the attack conduct with wartim urgenc and uncommon secreci led to the detent of more than number peopl suspect of violat immigr law be materi wit to terror or fight for the enemi the govern effort has produc few if ani law enforc coup most of the detaine have sinc been releas or deport with fewer than number still be held but it has provok a sprawl legal battl now be wage in feder courthous around the countri that expert say has begun to redefin the delic balanc between individu liberti and nation secur the main combat are the attorney general and feder prosecutor on one side and a network of public defend immigr and crimin defens lawyer civil libertarian and some constitut scholar on the other with feder judg in between the govern record has so far been decid mix as it has push civil liberti protect to their limit the court particular at the trial level have push back stop well short of endors mr ashcroft tactic or the rational he has offer to justifi them feder judg have howev allow the govern to hold two american citizen without charg in militari brig indefinit incommunicado and without a road map for how they might even challeng their detent in the nation histori the greatest battl over the reach of govern power have occur against the backdrop of wartim some scholar say the current restrict on civil liberti are relat minor by histor standard and in light of the risk the nation face the current struggl center on three set of issu peopl held simpli for immigr violat have object to new rule requir that their case be heard in secret and they have leverag those challeng into an attack on what they call unconstitut prevent detent peopl brought in and jail as materi wit those thought to have inform about terrorist plot have argu that they should not be held to give testimoni in grand juri investig final yasser esam hamdi and jose padilla the two american label "enemi combatants" for what the govern contend is more direct involv with terrorist group are seek right onc thought to be fundament to american citizen like a lawyer represent and a chanc to challeng their detent befor a civilian judg so far feder judg in newark and detroit have order secret deport proceed open to public scrutini and on friday a feder district judg in washington order that the ident of most of the detaine be made public under the freedom of inform act "secret arrests," judg gladi kessler wrote in the decis on friday "are a concept odious to a democrat society." a senior justic depart offici said the detent had been law and effect he said it was hard to "prove a negative" and cite specif terrorist act that had been disrupt but he said that depart offici believ that the detent had "incapacit and disrupt some ongo terrorist plans." two feder judg in new york have differ sharpli on whether the govern may jail materi wit while they wait to testifi in grand juri investig in virginia a feder judg order the govern to allow mr hamdi to consult a lawyer "i look at the feder district court judg and just cheer them on becaus they are do exact what an independ judiciari should be doing," said jane e kirtley a professor at the univers of minnesota and former execut director for the report committe for freedom of the press "it not hostil or adversari it simpli skeptical." these lower-court decis have for the most part not yet been test on appeal and there is reason to think that appeal court and the suprem court will prove more sympathet to the govern tactic and argument the feder appeal court in richmond va. for instanc revers the decis to allow mr hamdi to talk to a lawyer and order the lower court judg to consid addit evid and argument but even the appeal court seem torn and it reject the govern sweep argument that the court have no role in review the govern design of an american citizen as an enemi combat the detent issu also carri an emot punch mani of the arab and muslim caught in the govern dragnet were cabdriv construct worker or other type of labor and some spent up to seven month in jail befor be clear of terror tie and deport or releas last month at a confer held by a feder appeal court warren christoph the secretari of state in the clinton administr snap at viet dinh an assist attorney general under presid bush say that the administr refus to identifi the peopl it had detain remind him of the "disappeareds" in argentina "i'll never forget go to argentina and see the mother march in the street ask for the name of those be held by the government," mr christoph said "we must be veri care in this countri about take peopl into custodi without reveal their names." mr dinh who came to the unit state as a refuge from vietnam recal his famili anguish when his father was taken away in number for "re-education." in contrast he said those detain by the unit state were not be secret held but were allow to go to the press and seek lawyer "these are not incognito detentions," he said "the onli thing we will not do is provid a road map for the investigations." accord to the justic depart number of the more than number peopl detain sinc sept number were held on immigr charg offici said recent that number remain in detent court paper indic there were about two dozen materi wit while most of the other detaine were held on various state and feder crimin charg presid bush also has announc plan to tri suspect foreign terrorist befor militari tribun though no such charg have been brought yet last month william g young the feder judg presid in boston over the crimin case against richard c reid a british citizen accus of tri to deton a bomb in his shoe on a trans-atlant flight note that the veri establish of those tribun "has the effect of diminish the american juri onc the central featur of american justice." judg young who was appoint by presid ronald reagan ad "this is the most profound shift in our legal institut in my lifetim and - most remark of all - it has taken place without engag ani broad public interest whatsoever." jack goldsmith and cass r sunstein professor at the univers of chicago law school have written that the bush administr polici are a minim challeng to civil liberti especi compar with chang dure the time of abraham lincoln and franklin d roosevelt what has chang they say is a greater sensit to civil liberti and a vast increas in mistrust of govern the secreci u. say hear are not trial ten day after last septemb attack michael j creppi the nation chief immigr judg quiet issu sweep instruct to hundr of judg for what would turn out to be more than number "special interest" immigr case "each of these case is to be heard separ from all other case on the docket," judg creppi wrote "the courtroom must be close for these case - no visitor no famili and no press." "this restriction," he continu "includ confirm or deni whether such a case is on the docket." the govern has never formal explain how it decid which visa violat would be singl out for this extraordinari process and it has insist that the design could not be review by the court but as it turn out most of these case involv arab and muslim men who were detain in fair haphazard way for exampl at traffic stop or through tip from suspici neighbor law enforc offici have acknowledg that onli a few of these detaine had ani signific inform about possibl terrorist as the rule on friday in washington suggest a seri of legal challeng to this secreci has result in strike legal setback for the administr sever court have order the proceed open and have voic consider skeptic about the govern justif for it detent polici general lee gelernt a lawyer at the american civil liberti union said the secreci of the proceed exacerb the hardship face by peopl who disappear from sight on violat that in the past would not have result in incarcer "prevent detention," he said "is such a radic departur from constitut tradit that we certain shouldn't be undertak it sole on the justic depart say-so." malek zeidan detent would have been unexcept had it not given rise to one of the legal challeng that threaten to end the secret proceed mr zeidan number is a syrian citizen who overstay his visa number year ago and has live in paterson n.j. for more than a decad over the year he has deliv pizza driven an ice cream truck and pump gas when the immigr and natur servic came around last jan number to ask him about a former roommat suspect of marriag fraud mr zeidan was work at dunkin donut and his expir visa soon cost him number day in custodi when a hear was final held three week after his detent the judg close the courtroom exclud mr zeidan cousin and report the close of proceed prompt lawsuit in feder court from both mr zeidan and two new jersey newspap in march the govern drop the "special interest" design mr zeiden was releas after post a bond and the case he file was dismiss the immigr charg against him will be consid in the fall "you'r one of the lucki ones," his lawyer regi fernandez recal tell mr zeidan given that other visa violat were held as long as six or seven month befor be deport or releas mr zeidan lawyer believ that their legal strategi which focus on open forc the govern hand "the govern was somehow link secreci to guilt," mr fernandez said "we figur if the public had access to these hear they would see that noth went on except multipl adjourn and delay." through a spokeswoman judg creppi declin to comment an i.n. offici who spoke on the condit that he not be name said the agenc had act proper in mr zeidan case and in similar case he said the immigr servic had alway detain peopl without bond who were link to crimin investig he ad that the agenc had no choic now but to detain a visa violat until the feder bureau of investig was sure the person was not involv in terror "consid the flip side - that you held him for two day and then deport him and number day later you found out he was a terrorist," the offici said the newspap lawsuit has continu it has alreadi onc reach the suprem court and the govern paper contain one of the fullest account of it posit on secreci and execut power it main argument is that the court have no role becaus immigr hear are not realli trial but are mere administr hear that can be close at will bennet zurofski who also repres mr zeidan said he was flabbergast by this suggest "a trial is a trial," he said "a person liberti is at stake a person is be held in jail a person is be told where to live." but in a sworn statement submit in sever court case dale l watson the execut assist director for counterterror and counterintellig at the f.b.i. outlin the reason behind the govern demand for total secreci "bit and piec of inform that may appear innocu in isol can be fit into a bigger pictur by terrorist groups," he said this rational for withhold inform sometim call the mosaic theori is controversi "it imposs to refute," professor kirtley said "becaus who can say with certainti that it not true?" in may john w bissel the chief judg of the feder district court in newark appoint by presid reagan rule for the newspap and order all deport hear nationwid to be open unless the govern is abl to show a need for a close hear on a case-by-cas basi his rule follow a similar one in detroit the month befor though that case involv onli a singl detaine the govern appeal to the court of appeal for the third circuit in philadelphia and ask it to block judg bissel order until the appeal was decid the court which will hear argument in septemb declin to do that a number of news organ includ the new york time file a brief as a friend of the court in support of the newspap the govern then ask the unit state suprem court to stay judg bissel order the court in a relat unusu move given that the case was not befor it for ani other purpos block judg bissel order suggest that it might have more sympathi for the govern argument the wit right violat lawyer contend late on sept number feder agent pull two nervous indian men moham jawe azmath and sy gul moham shah off an amtrak train near fort worth they were carri box cutter black hair dye and about number in cash and had also shave their bodi hair the agent suspicion were obvious the hijack had use box cutter and knive to take control of the aircraft and had receiv letter instruct them to "shave excess hair from the body." an f.b.i affidavit date sept number said there was probabl caus to believ that both of the indian men were involv in or "were associated" with those respons for the sept number attack but even though govern offici told report that the men had been detain as materi wit their lawyer now say that they were held last fall onli on immigr violat the distinct is import becaus a materi wit warrant bring the automat appoint of a government-paid lawyer while the govern doe not have to suppli a visa violat with counsel as a result the author were abl to question each of the men repeat about terror without a lawyer present their current lawyer say like some of the peopl who were pick up as materi wit the indian men were held in isol in jail in new york for extend period it was number day befor mr azmath receiv a lawyer and number day befor mr shah did their lawyer say "it wrong to keep a man in jail for number day and never bring him befor a magistr to advis him of his rights," mr shah lawyer lawrenc k feitel said in an interview "it wrong not to provid him with an attorney at the threshold it wrong to depict this as an i.n. investig when in truth and in fact it the main inquiri into the world trade center debacle." anthoni l ricco the lawyer for mr azmath said his client was interrog "often time for sever hour a day with multipl interview get rapid-fir question from three or four differ people." eventu the f.b.i and the prosecutor clear the men of ani involv in terror and both plead guilti in june in a credit-card fraud scheme and are await sentenc feder prosecutor said in court paper that both men consent to question each "was read and waiv his miranda right befor each interview," prosecutor wrote ad that each man confess to the credit card offens the unit state attorney in manhattan jame b comey would not comment on the specif case but said general of the govern tactic "i don't see ani violat of ani rule regul or law "i can understand defens lawyer not be happy," he said "but i know our posit after number was to use everi avail tool to stay within the rule but play the whole field and recogn the boundari but cover the whole field "we need to do whatev we can that legal to investig and disrupt," he ad today it is believ that onli a hand of the two dozen materi wit perhap as few as two are still be detain but the process of detain the wit has stir intens critic last april judg shira a scheindlin of feder district court in manhattan rule that the use of the law "to detain peopl who are presum innoc under our constitut in order to prevent potenti crime is an illegitim use of the statute." judg scheindlin said the materi wit law appli when wit were held to give testimoni at trial not for grand juri investig "sinc number judg scheindlin said "no congress has grant the govern the author to imprison an innoc person in order to guarante that he will testifi befor a grand juri conduct a crimin investigation." then last month chief judg michael b mukasey also of feder district court in manhattan upheld the govern use of the materi wit statut in grand juri investig critic judg scheindlin reason judg mukasey cite the assert in number by chief justic john marshal that "the public has a right to everi man evidence," held that detent of materi wit dure investig are proper the war captiv no lawyer allow under u. label yasser esam hamdi a saudi nation who was captur in afghanistan is probabl an american citizen by virtu of have been born in louisiana his case repres the core issu of what kind of role the nation court should have if ani in review the govern imprison of someon charg with someth akin to a war crime prosecutor will be back in feder district court in norfolk va. next thursday to confront one of the feder judg who has shown resist to the govern approach that onc someon is declar an "enemi combatant" by the presid all judici review ceas judg robert g doumar an appointe of presid reagan has twice rule that mr hamdi is entitl to a lawyer and order the govern to allow frank dunham the feder public defend to be allow to visit him without govern offici or listen devic judg doumar said that "fair play and fundament justice" requir it he said the govern "could not cite one case where a prison of ani varieti within the jurisdict of a unit state district court who was held incommunicado and indefinitely." but the three-judg panel of the appeal court stay judg doumar order say he had not fulli consid the govern need to keep mr hamdi incommunicado and more import the execut branch primaci in area of foreign and militari affair "the author to captur those who take up arm against america belong to the command in chief," chief judg j harvi wilkinson number wrote for the appeal panel but even judg wilkinson seem to evinc some surpris at the breadth of what the govern was assert when he ask the justic depart lawyer "you are say that the judiciari has no right to inquir at all into someon statur as an enemi combatant?" the govern has relent slight agre to provid the court with a seal declar of the criteria by which they have judg mr hamdi to be an enemi combat but the govern has argu that judg cannot argu with the standard judg doumar has indic that he will question the govern close on those standard the case of jose padilla which has not progress as far as that of mr hamdi may present an even greater challeng to normal judici procedur mr padilla also known as abdullah al-muhajir is like mr hamdi an american citizen imprison in a naval brig after have been declar an enemi combat but unlik mr hamdi mr padilla was not arrest on the battlefield by the militari but on unit state soil by civil law enforc author on may number in chicago after his detent as a materi wit base on suspicion that he was seek to obtain materi and inform to build a radioact bomb he was transfer to militari custodi "this is the model we all fear or should fear," said mr dunham the public defend "the execut branch can arrest
