jaroff on it way back from the pacif island of tinian where it had deliv the uranium core for the atom bomb that destroy hiroshima the heavi cruiser indianapoli was torpedo by the japanes submarin number and sent to the bottom of the philippin sea it was one of the worst disast in american naval histori onli number of it near number crew member surviv now expert at southwest texa state univers have given that tragic stori a startl new twist it was the moon they say that sank the indianapoli or anyway they write in the juli issu of sky & telescop it was the moon that made the sink possibl use astronom comput program record and weather report as well as the known coordin and run speed of the ship and the submarin that sank it the author determin that when the number surfac it was perfect align west to east with the cruiser and they said a three-quart moon had just emerg from behind the cloud look across the moonlit water an number crewman spot the ship silhouet against the sky number mile away half an hour later six torpedo sent it to the bottom "it was sheer chance," said dr donald olson an astronom "without that align with the moon the lookout would not have spot the cruiser especi at that distance." with russel doescher a physic lectur dr olson conduct a univers honor cours call "astronomi in art histori and literature." in the last number year he has pinpoint the time and place of the render of art masterpiec given new interpret of astronom refer in chaucer and reveal the decis role of the moon in militari and other encount two year ago for exampl dr olson turn his attent to the bright star in van gogh "white hous at night." he and some student went to auver franc where van gogh creat his final work and search until they found the hous larg unchang sift through letter from van gogh to his brother dr olson found that the paint was complet in june number note the orient of the hous in the paint he determin where van gogh had set his easel and what section of the sky he had portray and from the light and shadow he establish that the hous had been illumin by the set sun his comput analysi then identifi the "star." it was venus which in earli even in mid-jun had occupi that part of the sky a final check of local weather record pinpoint the actual date van gogh had compos the paint june number the onli clear day in the middl of the month that year dr olson has also turn his attent to shakespear intrigu by the open of "hamlet," when guard on the rampart of elsinor refer to the "star that westward from the pole had made his cours to illum that part of heaven where now it burns." from the guard descript the season and the time other astronom had suggest sever bright star as possibl but dr olson calcul place it in the constel cassiopeia which lack ani notabl lumin star ponder this problem on a trip with his wife dr olson was sudden inspir he was awar that in number a supernova call tycho star for the danish astronom tycho brahe sudden flame in cassiopeia creat a worldwid sensat shakespear number at the time would certain have recal the event and his memori was probabl refresh by the descript of the supernova in a histori book that was the sourc of some of his best-known play dr olson has no doubt that the star that glare abov elsinor that night was tycho and he has an impress record of other astronomy-bas sleuth awar that the photograph ansel adam often neglect to date his negat dr olson set out to find when adam had shot his classic "moon and half dome." at yosemit dr olson and his student found adam vantag point studi the locat phase and featur of the moon in the photograph plus the shadow on the dome snow on the peak and other clue and then announc that the pictur had been taken at number p.m. dec number number then dr olson calcul that the set would be virtual ident at number p.m on dec number number on that day adam daughter-in-law visit yosemit and was photograph hold a print of "moon and the half dome" in the foreground of an eerili similar view of the actual moon and the half dome analyz chaucer work dr olson has confirm that a particular rapid movement of the moon describ in "the merchant tale" occur in april number and in "the franklin tale," chaucer descript of the heaven align that caus an except high tide on the brittani coast convinc dr olson that chaucer was an advanc amateur astronom then there was paul rever on his way to saddl up for his famous ride how did he manag to row undetect past a british warship on a moonlit night in boston harbor dr olson comput program reveal that while the moon was near full that night it was unusu close to the southern horizon and did not illumin rever boat dr olson proudest achiev was explain "the tide that failed" in the bloodi marin corp land at tarawa atol on nov number number planner had expect a tide to provid a water depth of five feet over a reef some number yard from shore allow larger land craft with draft of at least four feet to pass but that day and the next in the word of some observ "the ocean just sat there," provid neither low tide nor high tide and leav a mean depth of three feet over the reef the craft ground on the edg of the reef and mani marin were kill or injur as they wade number yard to the shore rifl over their head in the face of machine-gun fire from the japanes ask by a former marin about the tidal phenomenon dr olson spent six month research and master tidal theori and discov that the militari planner were awar that they had to contend with a "neap" tide this phenomenon occur twice a month when the moon is near it first or last quarter becaus the counter tug of the sun caus water level to deviat less but that day the moon was also almost at it farthest point from earth and exert even less pull leav the water relat undisturb and the marin in troubl "i'm not in the least blame the planners," dr olson said explain that the techniqu use in accur determin tide hadn't been appli to the water at tarawa inde he modest claim by use his comput program "we can calcul the tide in ani port in the world on ani day in history." yet dr olson greatest satisfact seem to stem from his interdisciplinari approach to astronom sleuth "i have thought about van gogh about shakespear and chaucer," he say "and that has made my life as a scientist much richer."
