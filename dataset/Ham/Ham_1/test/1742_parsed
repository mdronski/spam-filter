 a littl tidbit for those who still believ in scienc by opinion poll.. cheer rah number just ask the expert by salli baliuna and willi soon number in number the nation scienc foundat survey number peopl nationwid and found that percent believ that "increas carbon dioxid and other gase releas into the atmospher will if uncheck lead to global warm ..." yet half of those poll believ that human and dinosaur co-exist on earth despit the scientif fact that the dinosaur went extinct ten of million of year befor the earliest hominid appear wors onli percent of the respond understood what a molecul - for exampl carbon dioxid - is as in the case of the belief by mani that dinosaur and earli human co-exist public opinion doe not chang the actual fact about the materi world such a poll measur noth more than the degre of public ignor about scientif matter most peopl get news stori about scienc and technolog develop from televis and after more than a decad of be fed what-if stori about global warm from human activ no wonder most peopl "believe" that global warm "will" occur howev on the anxieti scale onli percent "worri a great deal" about global warm a worri that rank at number out of number environment concern the top environment fear share by percent of those poll was pollut drink water so what do we know concern the latest understand on human-mad global warm here are three point we know from the scienc number the surfac record of temperatur from thermomet show widespread warm in the number centuri compar to the number there was one period of warm earli in the number centuri the second after the number ecosystem have respond to this widespread warmth not seen sinc ca number -
