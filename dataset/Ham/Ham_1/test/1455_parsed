calabasa hill ca want to turn the microprocessor world on it head by do the unthink toss out the clock and let the signal move about unencumb for those design inspir by research conduct at nearbi caltech clock are for wimp the fulcrum microsystem inc design team isn't the first to propos an asynchron processor but presid and chief execut offic robert nunn want to be the first to take a clockless fire-breath processor mainstream "we realli deal with an asynchron world," he said "we onli make it synchron for our own convenience." this is the kind of stuff that mani in the processor industri would consid lunat fring too weird for conserv embedded-system design but the young processor compani and more than a dozen other like it are anchor in the mainstream courtesi of the mip instruction-set architectur more and more mip is becom the choic for maverick processor design team seek a place at the high end by field unorthodox devic and if motorola and ibm in the powerpc camp aren't care they could see their perform leadership in the high-end embedded-processor market snatch away by some of these upstart in austin texa meanwhil design at anoth mip hous intrins inc. aren't prepar to ditch the clock but they are put a new spin on some old trick such as give each gate it own clock and then let them overlap use such sleight of hand the compani hope to soon deliv risc-bas processor that run at an eye-pop number ghz and consum just number to number watt fulcrum intrins and their brethren may onc have been written off as interest experi back by ventur capitalist who overlook some of the finer detail like softwar compat what lend them respect is mip their for the ask one reason young processor compani seem to be flock to the platform is that it steward mip technolog inc. has no qualm about licens the instruction-set architectur (isa) provid that the license agre to meet a software-compat test suit by contrast processor-cor rival arm ltd has grant this privileg to just two of it mani license intel and motorola and so far the two powerpc vendor ibm corp and motorola inc. have rebuf most request to licens that architectur with the notabl except be fpga vendor xilinx inc. which has licens the number powerpc from ibm the mip isa is also one of the simplest form of reduced-instruction-set comput around which tend to make it attract to processor design interest in extend the architectur it was this and the wide avail of tool and softwar that drew intrins to mip even though the compani is aim at powerpc socket as evidenc by it decis to adopt the rapidio interfac instead of hypertransport which has been favor by mip vendor good fit "it a nice clean architectur and has an open model that allow us to add instructions," said paul nixon chief execut offic of intrins "you also get all the third-parti tool that veri easili fit into our base of platforms." there was a time when this open was seen as a liabil for mip in the number befor mip was spun out from silicon graphic inc. the instruct set lack a multiply-add instruct so some mip vendor took it upon themselv to creat their own the problem was that this broke mani of the develop tool caus headach for compil vendor like green hill softwar inc "we went to mip and said we have number differ compil variant and it embarrassing," said craig franklin vice presid of engin at green hill and a respect microprocessor industri veteran franklin also wasn't shi about tell mip it need to revamp it embed applic binari interfac "we went to mip and said we'v done a dozen eabi let clean up yours," he said mip took the advic and wast littl time clamp down on architectur deviat observ said but the mip camp still has to live with a legaci of incompat chip in the field "to it credit mip quick caught on," said jim turley a microprocessor industri analyst "go forward mip is maintain good control but they are still haunt by incompat among multiples." if the biggest risk to the mip camp is fragment then the powerpc camp has the opposit problem architectur confin though the powerpc architectur carri the cachet of household name motorola and ibm these are essenti the onli two compani that provid powerpc it not for lack of interest rather the compani have been reluct to cede control over the architectur this could wind up hurt the powerpc caus though "to get a powerpc licens is imposs or veri expensive," green hill franklin said "tactic this may have been a mistak if you'r a japanes compani all thing be equal you'd rather buy from anoth japanes company." analyst turley too think the powerpc camp will onli stand to gain by licens the architectur "it all about softwar compat and tool support the more you can prolifer the architectur the better you'r go to do," he said "i don't think motorola and ibm can address the entir market by themselves." there a chanc that this could chang ibm for it part is in the process of plan an expans strategi for powerpc that may involv more licens though it unlik the powerpc camp will ever have the open licens model of mip technolog mip processor vendor may have more than just two competitor to worri about "we'r certain not avers to [licensing]," said lisa su director of powerpc product at ibm "the question is how much do we do and who do we licens to there are various way you could go whether it a hard core soft core or licens the isa." but the fear of architectur fragment still loom larg "we know that if we have differ microarchitectur we have to do work on softwar compatibility," su said "with mip there a degre of fractur that may not alway be a big problem but if you go to other market -- like consum -- it becom big our belief is there is a happi medium." whatev path ibm take it will act in it own best interest as a chip provid not as a compani that want to hawk intellectu properti this is whi the xilinx licens deal work for ibm big blue is not so much interest in the royalti and fee it collect from xilinx but in the dual benefit of widen the appeal of the architectur and the revenu ibm generat from manufactur the fpgas for xilinx in it own fab "we'r not tri to make money off of licensing," su said manufactur is probabl one of the most power weapon that powerpc vendor ibm and motorola wield both have gussi up their high-end line with copper interconnect and silicon-on-insul technolog still rariti among chip maker this has help both compani design relat low-pow embed processor run at number ghz that are ship today ibm did it use number design rule and a four-stag pipelin motorola is use number design rule and a seven-stag pipe the compani say there more perform headroom in store "when we get to number micron we'll get substanti faster," said raj handa powerpc and powerquicc market manag at motorola proprietari process most mip processor vendor by contrast reli on mainstream foundri that haven't develop the more-exot process technolog and even though compani like motorola are shift more capac to outsid foundri they'r keep their special process recip in-hous to juic up their high-perform devic lack this capabl most mip processor vendor will have littl choic but to come up with dazzl architectur feat to keep up their chop at the high end it should becom clear in the next year or so how some of the newer player measur up intrins hope to field it number processor by the end of the year fulcrum is shoot for an earli number introduct "we'r go to shock the industri in term of raw perform and speed-vs.-pow performance," fulcrum nunn said "we realli want to chang the way the world

high-tech busi tip two for would-b entrepreneur do a product that you want to do not one that they want you to do startup founder general have onli idea charisma and equiti to work with idea and charisma are cheap but equiti is expens to make a start-up work the founder has to divvi out part of the busi at just the right rate to keep everyon happi until the product is a success give away too much of your compani too soon to a ventur capitalist to your co-work or even to yourself and you risk run out of distribut share befor the product is done and that probabl mean the product won't be done ever tip three for would-b entrepreneur don't take ventur fund too soon if you are do a softwar product don't take ventur money until you need it to introduc the product don't take ventur money until you have use up all of your own money your mother-in-law money and everyth you can borrow bootstrap rent don't buy don't hire peopl to do thing you can contract out becaus contractor don't
