 hi all i'v decid at last to test the alsa sound driver as usual the result is that i'v spent much more time repackag the darn thing than actual test the function or tri to hear the great sound qualiti peopl seem to think it outputs.. but hey some of you will benefit from that right ;-) i'v got the whole thing work on a valhalla system but the packag should easili instal or at least recompil on enigma limbo/(null) and mayb other who know ;-) here are quick instruct for those of you that wish to tri it out  - recompil the "alsa-driver" sourc rpm for your run kernel (you can instal the binari packag if you'r use the number number - instal this "alsa-driver" packag - instal the "alsa-libs" packag - instal the "alsa-utils" packag now go to this url and find out what you need to chang in your /etc/modules.conf file to replac the default oss driver load  URL (veri complet and veri good documentation!) hope you'll see that your card *is* support ;-) reboot or remov by hand your current sound modul (you'll probabl need to stop mani applic to free the sound resource...) "bi hand" and insert the new one if all is well you'v got alsa work ("dmesg" to check is a good idea) you now just need to adjust the volum level with e.g aumix and alsamix becaus everyth is mute by default with "aplay" you can alreadi test file to see if you hear anyth you can also instal the xmms plugin (seem to make my xmms segfault on exit.. hmmm but mayb it anoth plugin) to listen to your good ol number files.. that it it realli isn't complic and has never been from what i see the onli thing i dislik was to have to instal from source.. but as i can't imagin myself do that ;-) i'v repackag everyth clean even the /dev entri are includ in the rpm packag (and *not* creat by an ugli percent script i insist!) and seamless integr into the /etc/makedev.d structur there are also a few other notic differ with the default provid alsa spec file for exampl i'v split alsa-lib develop file into an alsa-lib-devel packag and includ static libraries.. there are other of cours (oh yes the kernel version against which the "alsa-driver" packag is compil get neat integr in the rpm releas so doe the architecture!) i'm open to ani comment or suggest about these packag download  URL current spec file  URL URL URL (all other patch etc  URL ) matthia ps as an extra bonus i'v also recompil xine with alsa support simpli run "xine -a number and off you go it may even support number and s/pdif ;-) -- clean custom red hat linux rpm packag  URL red hat linux releas number (valhalla) run linux kernel number load  number number number ac on-lin batteri charg percent number _______________________________________________ rpm-list mail list email URL
