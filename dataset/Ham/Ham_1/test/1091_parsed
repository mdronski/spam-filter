 on mon number at number dave wilson wrote  iirc if the queri string contain   varname=first&varname=second   then php will creat a variabl call "varname" with result second  howev if the queri string contain   varname[]=first&varname[]=second   then php will creat an array with number and number by far the coolest solut to this would be to "fix" php :) take a look at main/php_variables.c in the php sourc distribut you could mess around with the variabl is_array in php_register_variable_ex() and see if you can forc all variabl to be array :) as far as i can tell the reason they do this is to save time by not have to work out which variabl have multipl valu nick _______________________________________________ webdev mail list email URL
