change" hook creat a proc name  hook_folderchangesometh (where "something" is meaning and like  to be uniqu in the univers just in case you distribut this to  others) put the proc in a file in your ~/.tk/exmh directori  regener the tclindex restart exmh  in that proc you can do anyth you want like rewrit your  ~/mail/comp file yeah that would work tho there are race condit and likely/poss ugli side effect (eg unintent left-ov comp files) i'v end up take a veri differ rout tmda URL in particular i use tmda outbound filter to add custom plus address to the messag i send to specif list for exampl for the tmda-us list i want a from address of email so the relev outbound filter is to email ext=tmda which rewrit my from header transpar when i get next month batch of password remind from mailman list i'll be run about resubscrib to each list either with a standard plus address or a tmda-bas sender address (ie an address which onli the list in question is abl to send mail to) -+- get tmda fulli happi with nmh was a minor pain reason nmh like mh by default deliv outbound mail via smtp to port number on a defin host the port number cannot be configur (it call getservbyname() which doe a lookup against "smtp" in /etc/services) ergo you are constrain to use tell nmh to use tmda-sendmail instead of smtp use sendmail as the deliveri method under mh instead of smtp is not recommend as is lose a number of use bit of robust in mail deliveri failur mode further when nmh is configur to use sendmail instead of smtp nmh whom tool call sendmail as follow .../sendmail/ -m -t -i -bv which creat problem postfix doe not support "-bv" and return in error exim doe not support "-t" with "-bv" and return in error don't mention qmail i won't use it "whom" is far too use as a compon tool in mh to lose it would be nice if someon gave the new crew work on nmh a shout about this the "-bv" option to sendmail is pretti damn close to be allman sendmail specif and thus unfriend to other mtas further there are mani case where it would be use to configur a non-standard port to deliv outbound mail to via smtp nmh current insist on onli use port number (or as specifi in /etc/services) is a pain i'v work out a hack to use tmda with exim while retain nmh "whom" support use exim system filter number make sure that the follow option are set in ~/.tmda/config datadir number crypt_key_fil fingerprint number chgrp everyth in and under ~/.tmda to group "mail" number configur exim as per the current tmda how-to number set the follow option in exim.conf message_filt = "/etc/exim/filter" message_filter_pipe_transport = address_pip number /etc/exim/filt read # exim filter testprint "local_part dollar dollar testprint "domain dollar dollar if dollar is "" and dollar dollar is "kanga.nu" and dollar exist dollar {true}{false}}" is "true" then pipe "/usr/bin/tmda-inject -c dollar finish endif yes that assum that all user directori are under /home and that they use ~/.tmda/config instead of ~/.tmdarc hack appropri for your setup basic explan exim send all outbound mail thru the system filter (if one is configured) befor attempt deliveri the abov system filter extract the user from the from address and pipe the messag thru that user tmda setup via tmda-inject the system filter run as the same user as exim thus the requir for the chgrp mail if your exim instal run as a differ user chgrp as appropri it should be fair easi to do someth similar under postfix but i haven't investig that end note this requir that all outbound mail that is to be process with tmda has a from header which refer a local user (suffix are fine) and that the from address is fulli qualifi with a known domain if you'r vhost the abov setup would be fair trivial to extend for other domain and dollar path i'm not vhost on my desktop and so don't care you could also qualifi on envelop or other header if you wish a nice side effect of this approach for those run share mail server is that all user who have tmda config instant get tmda support for their outbound mail -- and in a manner that is less complex and less prone to end-us error than the typic tmda configur caveat emptor obnot i'v also written a small patch against tmda number to add a "hold" deliveri method (ident to "confirm" except it send no confirm request -- veri use for test config or do silent sidetrack of mail) -- j c
