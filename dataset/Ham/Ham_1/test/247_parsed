 sure it would be faster to save you conf file instal it on the box again copi back you conf and voila all you car about are the conf as the boit has no data right that what i would do but you sysadmin have to make life as difficult & complic as possibl ;--) have you thought about mirror the system drive might save you serious hassl down the line onli kid but that what i would do cw ---------------- ok here how to do it number .. while the disk is still instal in the number machin (if that broken beg borrow or steal...) remov the number version of glibc and kernel and instal the number version this will break one or two other packag sinc they have entri in /etc/ld.so.conf which belong to glibc these packag will need to be reinstal so number rpm -e --nodep glibc your /etc/ld.so.conf has been save as /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsav number rpm -ivh number number rpm -e --nodep kernel number rpm -ivh number this instal the number version of kernel and glibc you'll be abl to boot in a non number machin now howev x is now broken as is kerbero at least those are the two i notic your /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsav will contain clue as to what els might be broken to fix x and kerbero you need to reinstal their lib (copi /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsav back to /etc/ld.so.conf doesn't seem to work) number rpm -ivh --replacepkg number number rpm -ivh --replacepkg number fix them other lib list in _my_ /etc/ld.so.conf are qt mysql and sane if they start behav in odd fashion it may be relat reinstal the lib for these packag may fix that thank guys..  [snip]     [i] wouldn't bog it down with x either     that a thought but it may be use for the server to be avail as a   user machin also (mayb staff onli maybew admin only) in ani   case the   local admin (who doesn't exist as yet) will probabl be use gui   tool rather   than cli ones..   well yes it could be run love gui tool as well though are you  sure you want to have them avail most of the one i'v seen are better  of to be put down i'd rather then be use webmin for day to day  mainten and give the local admin just a restrict set of thing they  can do with it like ad and remov user and the like then the  "dangerous" part of the admin side can be "hidden" away from their  pri hand true they can alway break into it sinc they have physic  access to it as well on the other hand it would be better if they contact  yourself for the remain admin task sinc i believ this was suppos to  be remot administ by yourself iirc? sinc this thing will be on a sub number dialup ani remot admin will be strict of the emerg varieti i plan to have the server mail me it log and stuff regurlar so i can keep an eye on it but most/al of the admin will be done local conor number "it" be migrat a hard disk from an intel number box to an amd number box essenti the number processor is an number class while the amd number processor is an number class (not sure about the amd athlon or duron chips) a rhl instal on the number class machin will not boot on an number calss box sinc both kernel and glibc are optimis for number the solut is to replac the number kernel and glibc with number version -- conor dali met eireann glasnevin hill dublin number ireland ph number number number fax number number number ------------------------------------ bofh.irmet.i run redhat linux number up number day number number user load averag number number number ********************************************************************** this email and ani file transmit with it are confidenti and intend sole for the use of the individu or entiti to whom they are address if you have receiv this email in error pleas notifi the system manag this footnot also confirm that this email messag has been swept for the presenc of comput virus ********************************************************************** -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
