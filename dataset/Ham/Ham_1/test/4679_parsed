the averag salari for a univers graduat (includ advanc degre holders) here is dollar number --  number us no wonder half of san francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call center that have arriv here in the last coupl of year - i think they hire some entri level it peopl for around number number us) an hour which of cours fit perfect for me - my entri level job in number paid number an hour the fundament differ is that most of the job that requir a trade are *unionized*.in other word in this part of the world for the vast major of peopl union due are a better invest than tuition the counter-argu to this is that mani colleg graduat leav for better work elsewher but the counter-count argument is that we are the thin edg (one of sever realli - prison labor in the us would be another) of third-world wage and work practic come to north america i work at a compani that had a number wage freez the fact that they could maintain that (and prosper) just say volum about the economi in this part of the world i met mani peopl there like me who felt that was fine i can vote with my feet they didn't quit realiz that just about everi larg employ in the area has similar or wors polici anyway eventu they start a union drive dure the vote retir employe were brought in by the employ (rumour were that they were paid the go rate for a vote around here - a bottl of rum) and somehow allow to vote  the union file a grievanc - which was deni - by a minist of labour who hey guess what - use to be a vp at the compani that free labor market at work the busi continu to prosper - as i was told when i was there - it is a cash cow as long as the joa (joint oper agreement) with the compet paper is in place and if you think that ani of those wonder american compani out of some free-enterpris belief in compet for the best talent are go to do anyth about that sorri most of them receiv generous subsidi in return i'm sure for an understand about the labor market here   if we ever actual *had* free market in this countri  the abolit of redistribut incom and death tax  those smart peopl in the forb number would have *more* money and  would be *more* self-mad peopl on that list in addit  of the peopl who *inherited* money on the list would have  less of it not even relat speak final practic  of that "new" money would have come from econom effici and  "stolen" from someon els invest bubbl or not   effici is call "progress" for those of you in the  republ of berkeley or cambridg it mean more and better  cheaper over time -- a terribl petit-bourgeoi concept  not worthi of teach by the educ elit or you'd  about it by now in econom term it also call an increas  general welfar and no virginia i'm not talk about  money from someon who work and give it to someon who  in order to keep them from work and they can think of some  as santa claus come elect time..   much as i like to accept what you say - i do believ in free market  i have difficulti find ani - except of cours for labor market which govern go to great length to protect (well unless the suppli is tight) it was a great run with the technolog industri - produc most of the self-mad billionair on the list but now we'v got a government-sponsor monopoli and the concept of "more stuff cheaper" which it has alway promis - seem to be disappear a particular gall exampl is high-spe internet access an articl i read a coupl of year ago that it is an area where the price approach of the it industri (cheaper better or you die) and the telecom industri (maintain your monopoli through regul and get guarante price increas through the same regulators) meet sad to say the telecom industri seem to have won the whole entertain industry/riaa/palladium thing seem to be anoth instanc where actual give valu to the custom seem less import than use regul to reduc competit and substitut product in order to produc profit for the favor few   short then econom is not a zero sum game properti is not  the rich don't get rich off the back of the poor and  labor "theory" of valu happi horseshit is just  horseshit happi or otherwis   believ otherwis is -- quit liter given the time marx  capit and the manifesto -- romant nonsens   i usual agre -

use the word "compassionate" a lot i guess i tend to believ that a certain amount of poverti reduct actual help a modern capitalist state - the basic econom tenet of the republ parti seem to be the more homeless under each overpass the more effici the rest of us will be and the fact are for most peopl in the western world are declin standard of live declin benefit disappear social safeti net greater work hour essenti sinc the entranc of women into the work forc (not blame women in ani way they have a right to work but it now number wage-earn in each famili and still declin standard of living) is the realiti again to quot that wonder liber document i keep come back to -
