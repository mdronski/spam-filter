  i think it would make more sens to start habea with a less  aggress score (one which will not give spammer a quick path  into everyon inbox) and after we'v seen evid that the  system work then we can increas the magnitud of the score better yet let the ga figur out the correct score ;-) that will obvious take awhil sinc you'll have to acquir enough messag with it but it should give you a good idea if the presenc of habeus header are good spam indic or not if they are my guess is that habeus will probabl not succeed take thing further off-top doe habeus charg a licens fee to organ who want to use their copyright materi or is their sole revenu stream to come from legal judgement on the one hand if they charg licens fee i'd worri that when time got tough they'd be somewhat less critic of organ we'd call spammer today in order to generat licens fee if not i'd worri the pendulum would swing the other way and they'd go after legitim busi in an attempt to generat more revenu from judgement and/or out of court settlement either way it seem like they have an interest tightrop to walk -- skip montanaro email consult URL ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsor by:thinkgeek welcom to geek heaven URL _______________________________________________ spamassassin-talk mail list email URL
