 hi all i'v run into a fair intract (for me) problem and was wonder if anybodi could give me pointer on how to deal with it i am run debian woodi on a pentium iii ide base system i have a ricoh number ide cd rewrit which i use use cdrecord and the scsi over ide kernel modul i was run kernel number until probabl last weekend when i notic number was out download patch and instal new kernel with no real problem this morn i went to burn a cdrom and the system lock hard reboot into number allow cdburn to work fine this problem is veri reproduc (on my system at least) the cdrecord command i was use was cdrecord -v number blank=fast number -data bak.iso the blank appear to go ok but when it tri to write data it just lock up the entir system (can't ping it from outsid even) afaic the system just stop hard reset is onli way back in and when it doe reboot i cannot see anyth use in ani logfil (/var/log/messag /var/log/kern.log /var/log/syslog at ani rate) cdrecord -scanbus work fine and report the two pseudo-scsi devic (mi cdr drive and my cdrw) the same lock occur even if there is no blank i tri upgrad to number (on assumpt that if there was a kernel issu it might have been fix in these patches) but it give the same error i also download and compil the sourc for cdrecord number and instal it instead of the debian packag (i was wonder if mayb there was some compil option the packag had use which mayb would caus the problem) and still the problem persist anyway i'm complet stump googl search has not done me much good and i'm a littl bit lost what i'd like to know is a) how to fix the problem ;-) b) is this like to be an applic or kernel problem the sever of the crash would make me suspect it is a kernel problem but i'm not veri knowledg on these thing c) should i post a descript of this to the kernel mail list if this is an appropri cours of action are there ani tip (beyond the guidelin on kernel.org) like i said i'm lost on this one so ani info is veri grate receiv mick -- michael conri number web URL key fingerprint = number number number number number number number number number number -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
