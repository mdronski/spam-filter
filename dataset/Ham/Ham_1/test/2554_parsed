 onc upon a time mark wrote   i'm just play with gnuboy (game boy emulator) as it fair simpl  and small  i'm have a few problem with the percent macro  after read thru maximum rpm and the rpm doc i'm still stuck on one  thing in the sourc for gnuboy there is a directori call doc that  contain well the doc   i'm not sure what to pass to the percent macro  i origin tri  percent chang config credit faq hack liberti readme.old   and it moan about miss file would i have to put a few line in the  percent macro just befor configur to move the doc out of that  directori and into the build root   ie mv docs/* ../ actual i'v alreadi rebuild gnuboy i just had forgotten to commit the spec file which is now done  URL basic percent is use to put file in percent (default to percent and the list file with relat path (i.e that don't start with a "/") are relat to the percent (the uncompress sourc usually) so either you can choos to have a "docs" directori insid percent by put  percent doc (or total equival the latter just remind it a directory) percent docs/ or you can put all file that are in docs/ direct in percent  percent docs/* tri both poke around and you should catch the differ if it not alreadi clear for you you can also mark ani file from the percent as document (will be list when use "-qd" to queri the packag docs) by use percent with absolut filenam for exampl  percent percent (this is /usr/share/foo-game/manu an absolut file) also for the packag conveni all file in /usr/share/man (aka percent are automat tag as percent  also one more thing what the best way to work out the depend  as for exampl with gnuboy all hte doc and the websit say is it  need sdl   do i set a requir sdl  number (as my system use number or just  put requir sdl build the packag onc and see if it check for a specif version or read the instal note often you'll see "check for sdl  number for exampl when run configur then it best to also make the packag depend on that version  one more quick question i'm use to compil sourc code no problem  (cannot program but stumbl through) what the best way for find  out what rpms are need for the requir & buildrequir macro  apart from read all the doc and websit info well read the doc inde :-) you can also compil the packag onc without those field and see what the configur script is check for (basic the lib and version you'll need to add to the buildrequires:) then onc the packag is built queri the automat depend that rpm put into it you'll see for instanc if the binaries/lib from the packag need sdl gtk+ etc then add those "requires:" and rebuild a final version of the packag often you can omit some depend for exampl if a program is check for glib gtk+ gdk-pixbuf and gnome librari when be compil buildrequir gnome-libs-devel requir gnome-lib will be enough sinc they alreadi depend on the "lower level" lib that are glib gtk+ and gdk-pixbuf  onc again sorri to bother you with this but i figur you were the  best one to ask well this is typic the type of inform interest to share with other so i'll copi this answer to the rpm-list hope some peopl will appreci :-)  p.s freshrpm rock . creep..creep thank ;-) matthia -- clean custom red hat linux rpm packag  URL red hat linux releas number (valhalla) run linux kernel number load  number number number ac on-lin batteri charg percent number _______________________________________________ rpm-list mail list email URL
