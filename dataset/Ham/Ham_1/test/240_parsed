 on fri jul number number at number number email wrote  the setup is as follow  i develop a piec of code use php number which is to  my knowledg gpl php is releas under the gpl yes  the piec of code run on my server and is an integr part of a system  that i have develop for a client i did not reciev payment for this  particular piec of code but i did reciev payment for the system my client  now want to use a differ servic provid but keep my code  do i have a right to claim intellectu properti right for my littl  piec of code that he did not pay me for or do i have to give the client the  code under the gpl exact what right you would have to the code depend on the contractu arrang you have with your client and i'm bet that that not at all cut and dri howev i have been in this situat where a client was use code i develop and then decid that he should own the code push never came to shove (at least not yet :-) ) but my understand of the situat vis a vis softwar is that in the absenc of ani contract grant ownership of the code to anoth parti it remain with the person who wrote it i didn't take legal advic on this but my custom did :-) and his lawyer told him that i was right and would most like win in court so much for the ownership of the code vis a vis you and your client - now for the gpl issu code compil by a compil which is gpl softwar (e.g gcc) is not itself cover by the gpl unless it author choos to make it so this is perhap not made clear enough in the gpl text and is a particular piec of fud which microsoft love to toss about similar the copi of php which is part of your custom system is cover by the gpl you can charg him whatev you like for it but you must provid him with acc to the sourc code and you cannot restrict what he can do with it (in this case move it to anoth servic provider) howev you have not (i take it) chosen to licens your code under the gpl so the condit of the gpl do not appli to it if otoh you had written some code which modifi php as such and then distribut (whether for a fee or not) that modifi php then the modifi code must be licens under the gpl but this appli to a modif to php itself and not to your script which run under php the relev claus is number which say (though lord know whi i'm quot when locat copi will turn up a shedload of copi of the gpl on just about ani linux box - number on this box) b) you must caus ani work that you distribut or publish that in whole or in part contain or is deriv from the program or ani part thereof to be licens as a whole at no charg to all third parti under the term of this licens your php script do not contain nor are they deriv from php in whole or in part  i know this is not strict a linux issu but ani help would be appreci microsoft has veri much made this a linux issu - it has attempt to impli that ani compani use gpl softwar must make everyth it own public and it must be true - that nice man from microsoft wouldn't lie would he  niall -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
