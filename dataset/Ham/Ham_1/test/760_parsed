that i actual had understood prior to all this - for  exampl commerci entiti with trial/limited/crippl edit   which is no problem - i don't see whi that should be a problem for  suse though - sure the more the merrrier as far as they'r  concern anyth either you or i have to say about their motiv is specul bear that disclaim in mind here mine they make money from sell box set they'r glad to make some version avail for almost-unrestrict distribut (not "for value") via cd duplic or the internet that they estim won't substitut for boxed-set sale for exampl they _could_ have packag what i call the "ftp edition" in number imag the fact that they didn't suggest to me that they see the inconveni of mirror ftp edit number file (which at the moment are v number as motiv for all but the realli determin to buy box set instead likewis they _could_ releas a v number (current) version of the "evaluation" single-disk iso imag instead they alway keep it sever version behind this again seem like an incent to buy a box set after "evaluating" suse via the iso imag again the abov is my specul (only) about their motiv all we know of a certainti is what permiss they'v grant which are a bit messi and complex but nonetheless quit clear those permiss as a remind appli to the suse-produc compon yast number the distribut instal program and possibl other util that i don't know of _they_ wrote that code and have everi right to grant or withhold permiss as suit them best  one can suspect what one like what i didn't understand was that suse  had proprietari extens that it wasn't prepar to allow peopl to  use under the gpl or even under a freebsd style licenc hmm let slow down here there a persist misconcept that it possibl to place somebodi els work under a new licenc without his permiss not so there is noth in copyright law that would make that possibl the copyright _owner_ has inher right in his (e.g. software) work and is entitl to issu as mani _instances_ of his code under divers licenc as he wish (if he give you a copi with no licenc statement there effect a default licenc by oper of copyright law to avoid go into a long digress let me just say that it a proprietari licenc by default that whi in order to have open sourc softwar at all there must be an explicit licenc from the copyright holder.) no linux distribut _ever_ entail relicens peopl softwar without their explicit permiss -- sinc no such relicens can occur at all you cannot get away with take suse linux ag work and redistribut it under what you claim to be a bsd licenc or the gpl or anyth at all other than what the copyright owner has specifi becaus you simpli lack the right to do so claim to do it would be copyright violat  i thought that the model for the like of suse was sell support and  customis rather than what i thought of as the core "product" i  thought that the like of yast came under core - mayb it work in  the glori day befor say number - i can understand that they might  want to make more money but the way in which they have done it seem  to me to be be against the spirit of the gpl if stallman and friend at the gpl (let alon linus torvald and kernel contributors) had intend to prohibit put gpled work on the same cds as proprietari one and sell the result onli via retail store (plus mail order etc.) in shrink-wrap box i'm percent certain they could and would have done so guess what they did not they didn't even requir that anybodi give you copi of the gpled compon ever at all all they did was requir that _if_ you receiv gpled softwar law then you had to be abl to get match sourc code for a limit period upon request spirit of the gpl you say i'd suggest that stallman and compani knew exact what they were do and that the degre of access to gpled softwar is exact what they had in mind  all i want is the os and gnu app i was under the impress that for  *_those_* all one need was to pay for the media and not for the code  itself   ai-j tort mai si you are inde under a misconcept and may want to read the text of the gpl to verifi this fact the gpl doe _not_ entitl you to a copi of ani binari softwar section number provid for right to access to match sourc code _if_ you have law receiv a copi of a cover binari that section provid three altern mechan for the distributor to provid such access and suse _do_ actual provid exact that access or so i think to be the case if you believ there some gpled codebas that you can law receiv from suse whose match sourc code they are not make avail exact as requir pleas tell us which codebas that is (that would be suse linux ag headach not ani of our but it might be interest to examine.)  my understand was that binari or whatev could be receiv for  the cost of the media plus a token of one appreci (the latter  be subject to agreement between the parties) - i was offer a  bottl of wine plus mayb a pint or two and a chat for a copi - i  don't know what the go rate is your understand is almost correct but not quit number the access provis of the gpl concern access to _sourc code_ not binari number it kick in _only_ for peopl who'v law receiv cover binari number _covered_ softwar mean instanc of codebas actual place under the gnu gpl by their copyright owner the mere act of place a piec of softwar on a cd-rom with gpled softwar doesn't gpl it in fact the assert to the contrari is a favourit fud tactic from enemi of linux they'r forev tri to convinc softwar produc that use gpled softwar in ani way with their proprietari offer will "taint" their copyright and forc them to put their properti under the gpl it simpli not so  if i want support from suse that would be a differ issu and  one for which i would be will to pay that nice but they'r not _offering_ the exact content of the box set free of charg and law to duplic & redistribut or "borrow" for one thing as you will have notic from my earlier list of compon the box set cd-rom includ quit a lot of _third-party_ proprietari softwar suse linux ag _cannot_ allow you (or your friend) to hand out copi of that softwar freeli becaus it not their in the first place  i have a friend with number - i think that i'll end up do that if you mean the number core set of rh number good it a quit decent distribut but bear in mind that the rh number box set includ some other third-parti applic whose owner would be veri upset to find them be copi or "borrowed"  i have now realis this thank to your kind explan i can  borrow them but not copi them no look it a collect of softwar mani element of which may not be law just given out to multipl peopl your friend instal it then _not_ eras it but mere let you "borrow" the cds result in the product be instal in multipl place that unauthoris copi  and as i'v tri to explain is not the licenc term on say  trial for commerci compani x to which i object it is the way suse  appear at least to my i.t peasant self to have mix up  proprietari and open stuff well if you don't like suse then you probabl won't like caldera edesk xandro desktop lycori deskop lx libranet lindow or krud either depend on your criteria you also might not like red hat linux-mandrak or yellow dog sinc all of those have boxed-set retail set that includ cd-rom that may not be public redistribut (i don't even use suse i'm just tri to clarifi the licens question.) -- cheer live faust die jung rick moen email -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
