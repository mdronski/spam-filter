high score as far as i can see that becaus spamassassin is  assign such high score to legit newslett these day and the  habea mark has to bring it down below that :( imo we have to fix  the high-scor anyway -- no spam ever *needs* to score over number in our  score system number == tag anyway this is off the topic of the rest of this discuss but amavisd (in all it incarnations) and mimedefang and sever other mta plugin all reject at smtp time messag that score higher than some threshold (often number if some new releas were to start score all spam no higher than number there'd better be _zero_ fps becaus all those filter would drop their threshold to number on thu number aug number michael moncur wrote  but i agre that there need to be more focus on elimin rule that  frequent hit on newslett if ani newslett actual use the habea  mark that will be one way to help newslett won't use the mark habea is price way too high -- a factor of at least number over what the market will bear imo -- on a per-messag basi for most typic mail list (lockergnom say) to afford it on thu number aug number harold hallikainen wrote  habeus has come up with a veri clever way to use exist law to battl  spam it seem that at some point they could drop the licens fee to  number or less and make all their incom off su the spammer for  copyright infring sorri that just can't work if the habea mark actual becom both widespread enough in non-spam and effectively-enforc enough to be absent from spam such that e.g. sa could assign a posit score to messag that do not have it then spammer are out of busi and habea has no one to sue there nobodi left to charg except the peopl who want (or are forc against their will becaus their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark convers if there are enough spammer forg the mark for habea to make all it incom su them then the mark is useless for the purpos for which it was design either way it seem to me that after mayb a coupl of lawsuit against real spammer and a lot of cease-and-desist letter to clueless mom&pop then either (a) they'r out of busi (b) they have to sell the right to use the mark to increas question sender or (c) they'v both creat and monopol a market for "internet postag stamps" that everybodi has to pay them for the latter would be quit a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do absolut noth use unless you consid threaten peopl with lawsuit use yet still collect a fee either direct or indirect from everyon on the internet -- effect we'll be pay them for the privileg of polic their trademark for them i don't believ they'll ever get that far but i don't particular want to help them make it [*] and i use the term "they" loos becaus the whole compani could consist of one lawyer if it realli got to that point ------------------------------------------------------- this sf.net email is sponsor by:thinkgeek welcom to geek heaven URL _______________________________________________ spamassassin-talk mail list email URL
