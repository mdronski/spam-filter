"--defin target number --with smp" sound good enough  buildrequir on "kernel-source" will also need to be remov becaus  won't necessarili need to be true and that doe bug me a bit :-/ me and my kernel rpm build .. this all work along the same idea i have been aim for but the freak redhat kernel srpms still have been stump .. if we could get this and the alsa driver stuff work it would be whole lot easier to tri out a newer kernel .. but then the size of these rpms are huge at least for us number world courti .. ;-{ .. i will keep watch and hope that somebodi come up with a great work idea .. thank guy mail lee _______________________________________________ rpm-list mail list email URL
