   well i don't realli find it consist at all to use an rpm packag   built against someth that wasn't instal through rpm :-/   follow that reason i'v been instal all my custom-built  kernel through rpm recent i find it annoy though that  alsa-kernel and similar packag will onli build for the current  run kernel   so i'v attach a patch to specifi an altern kernel by set the  "target_kernel" environ variabl befor run rpmbuild you  still need to have the rpm for the specifi kernel instal but at  least it doesn't have to be current run it kinda hackish so  if someon has a better way to do this let me know   idea look good although it mayb need to be tweak a bit more (what  sent doesn't support packag name "kernel-smp") i'd also prefer a  way than the env variabl and preferr not edit the spec..  "--defin target number --with smp" sound good enough  buildrequir on "kernel-source" will also need to be remov becaus  won't necessarili need to be true and that doe bug me a bit :-/ me and my kernel rpm build .. this all work along the same idea i have been aim for but the freak redhat kernel srpms still have been stump .. if we could get this and the alsa driver stuff work it would be whole lot easier to tri out a newer kernel .. but then the size of these rpms are huge at least for us number world courti .. ;-{ .. i will keep watch and hope that somebodi come up with a great work idea .. thank guy mail lee _______________________________________________ rpm-list mail list email URL
