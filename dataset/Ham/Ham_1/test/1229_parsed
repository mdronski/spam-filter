 oh yeh one more thing none of this would explain whi the signatur for sample-spam.txt from spamassassin is regist on honor but not apt or fire -----origin message----- from rose bobbi sent thursday august number number number am to email email subject re [razor-users] what wrong with the razor server now thank that help there still so littl info on tes and those of us here sinc number know how it work i did set my min_cf to number which i thought would be zero so the way you are suggest that it work now is that everyon has a trust level of number and have to work their way up your trust level increas when someon nomin the same messag as spam this must have been the new chang made at the begin of the week unless the chang dump everyon trust level now here come the questions.. what engin signatur doe tes look at doe it have to be the same number signatur or doe it use the number or number signatur how mani peopl have to nomin the messag befor everyon rate increas how mani revok decreas someon rate doe a singl revok decreas the rate of everyon that nomin the messag if a newbi report a messag that has alreadi been report doe their trust level immedi go up in the case of revok doe someon with a trust level of number have the capabl to revok a messag submit by multipl peopl with higher trust level -----origin message----- from vipul ved prakash email sent thursday august number number number am to email subject re [razor-users] what wrong with the razor server now bobbi coupl of thing if you are not a trust report your report will not have an immedi effect it take a bunch of trust report to bump up the confid of a signatur to a point where it is consid to be spam this might be frustrat initi but as the number of trust user grow the time delay between nomin and determin will becom shorter of cours it a lot more frustat for peopl to have their legit mail filter out due to incorrect report also for the purpos of test i'd suggest make your min_cf (in razor-agents.conf) to number min_cf default to the server recommend averag confid which at the moment is number set min_cf to number should return true for whatev you submit (as long as it was not revok by a trust user) apt/fir sync with honor everi number minut so you'd have to wait for a _maximum_ of number minut befor signatur propag cheer vipul on wed aug number number at number number rose bobbi wrote  this is still happen noth that i report is be regist at  all i have confirm that this also affect the cloudmark outlook  plugin if i block a messag from outlook use spamnet then run it  against the folder contain the messag that was report then  noth happen   on the unix side i'v tri differ cloudmark server differ  identi report from differ system etc without an effect i did  find

subject re [razor-users] what wrong with the razor server now    on wed number aug number rose bobbi wrote    well at least it been confirm i can say for cetain that it   start on monday sinc that was when i notic a huge drop in stat  of messag   that were tag as be in razor and i know it was fine on  friday   it may have someth to do with the upgrad on the server that   vipul mention if tes is go to decid on what get regist   and what doesn't then razor-report should provid some debug info   about the refus you are correct about the need for more info on   tes but it probabl won't happen for fear of circumvent    rant regard secur through    on the way into work i thought of some fair easi way to circumv  what i imagin the current trust model to be base on individu user  blind submit report and check result   it hard to imagin other haven't as well as i'm not too bright    /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\  /\  /\/\/\  patrick greenwel  ask the
