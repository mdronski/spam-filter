 niall ask  i have about number of data which i need to copi from one disk to anoth  howev i'm not sure how i should best copi it the problem is the bulk of  the data is imag and most of these imag have two directori entri i.e  there is a hard link to each file if i copi them use cp -a or my usual  favourit of find  -pmd other_dir it go to copi each file twice  which is not what i want dump / restor would take care of this if the  sourc filesystem wasn't reiserf :-( ani suggest  how about someth like cd {dest.dir} tar -c {source.dir} cf -  tar xf - tar cf - will pipe the tar file to stdout and tar xf - will untar it this should keep permiss and link and if you do it as root you will keep the owner too.. :) not test though you may need other flag as well - matthew __________________________________________________ do you yahoo! everyth you'll ever need on one web page from news and sport to email and music chart URL -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
