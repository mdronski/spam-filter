 eugen leitl write  apart from twiddl with the surfac albedo which might be not  enough -- we current don't have ion drive with enough power or at  least we can't develop and deploy them on time my estim is that in the worst case we have number year number seconds) to move it one earth radius or about number km number m) a number = x if i rememb right so a = number which is number number number or about number number which is not a veri larg acceler rough equival to the gravit acceler in these part divid by number assum a number --- that is number number decimeter-wid --- spheric asteroid of specif graviti number number pi number say it would have a volum of number cubic decimet and thus a mass of number kg the forc we'd have to appli to achiev this acceler would be rough equival to the weight of number kg here on earth so yeah ion drive are probabl a no-go unless i screw up the calcul here i think the forc they typic exert is about four order of magnitud too small if we just want to hit today it with enough of an impuls that it would miss us number year later we'd need to acceler it by about number cm/s a one-ton number mass would need to hit it at about number m/s or about ten time the speed of light to achiev this so that not possibl (if you could actual put enough work into a one-ton mass as it approach the speed of light it would mass more so you could still do it with a one-ton mass but we don't have anyth approach that speed.) the impuls requir is invers proport to the remain time to impact so if we were to hit it after half the time has elaps we'd need to acceler it by around number cm/s instead the gravit forc of an earth-siz mass could provid suffici deflect if that mass were about number time as far away from the asteroid as we are from earth center or about number m or about number time the distanc from the earth to the sun number au) (and if that mass stay so nearbi for number years.) the effect of continu acceler benefit great from plan ahead sinc they scale with number not t --- and thus the need acceler scale with number after half the time has elaps we'd need four time as much acceler to make it miss the earth than if we were to start acceler it now all of these number are a littl low becaus the earth present a slight easier target than it physic size suggest due to it graviti well how much easier depend on the speed of the projectil in way i don't understand they'r also a littl high becaus they assum the forc is be appli pure at right angl to the asteroid current path which is a slight suboptim scenario (although for veloc chang five order of magnitud smaller than the relat veloc the differ is probabl insignificant.) and they assum there are no other effect on the asteroid path what about electr charg could we electr charg the asteroid and anoth nearbi asteroid perhap with electron beam to provid the need acceler of cours all of this calcul could be appli in the other direct too if you want to sock a moon coloni with a one-ton asteroid you could do it with a tini amount of forc appli over twenty-f year to adjust it orbit *** about spam i'm sorri to admit i haven't implement ani of the better solut and so i'm afraid i'll have to allow non-subscrib fork mail to be detain for scan i hope this measur can be revers soon when i have time to implement better measur as has often been note by other poster measur to reduc spam sent to the fork list will not signific decreas the spam load of forkpost sinc the vast major of spam receiv by forkpost is sent to them direct not through the fork list -- email kragen sitak URL silenc may not be golden but at least it quiet don't speak unless you can improv the silenc i have often regret my speech never my silenc -- ancient philosoph syrus (?) via adam rifkin email URL
