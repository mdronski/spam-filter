  (pleas feel free to forward this messag to other possibly-interest  parties.) some caveat (in decend order of concern) number these messag could end up be fals (or incorrectly) report to razor dcc pyzor etc certain rbls too i don't think the result for these distribut test can be trust in ani way shape or form when run over a public corpus number these messag could also be submit (more than once) to project like spamassassin that reli on filter result submiss for ga tune and develop number spammer could adopt element of the good messag to throw off filter and of cours there alway progress in technolog (bi both spammer and non-spammers) the second problem could be allevi somewhat by ad a nilsimsa signatur (or similar) to the mass-check file (the result format use by spamassassin) and give the messag file uniqu name number or number of each file) the third problem doesn't realli worri me these problem (and perhap other i have not identified) are uniqu to spam filter compress corpus and other performance-rel corpus have their own set of problem of cours in other word i don't think there ani replac for have multipl independ corpus find better way to distribut test and collat result seem like a more viabl long-term solut (and i'm glad we'r work on exact that for spamassassin) if you'r go to serious work on filter develop build a corpus of number messag (half spam/half non-spam) is not realli that much work if you don't get enough spam creat multi-techniqu spamtrap (web usenet repli to spam) is pretti easi and who doesn't get thousand of non-spam everi week ;-) dan
