numer communist parties)     while one can appreci the difficulti of   abandon idea with such   honor lineag the fact that social has been   wide discredit and   abandon in most place should prompt indian to   reconsid this   commit despit evid of it failur as an   econom system mani of   the socialist who carri on do so by tri to   proclaim that their dogma   reinforc certain civic virtu a presum merit   of social is that it   aim to nurtur a greater sens of collect   ident by suppress the   narrow self-interest of individu howev this   aspect of social lie   at the heart of it failur both as a polit tool   as well as the basi   for econom polici     let start with the econom failur of social   most of the grand   experi have been ignomini abandon or   recast in tortur term   such

on the basi of collect goal     socialist ideologu are impervi to evid that   their system inspir   even more human miseri in the civic realm this is   becaus social   provid the polit mechan for and legitimaci   by which peopl   identifi as member of group while it may suit the   socialist agenda to   creat them-and-us scenario relat to worker and   capitalist or   peasant and urban dweller this logic is readili   convert to other type   of divis     in the case of india competit for power has   increas becom   identifi with religios or ethnic as is   evid by the rise of the   bharatiya janata parti support by radic   hindutva support as   elsewher polit parti base on religion are   by their veri natur   exclusionari these narrow concept of ident work   against nation   build sinc such a polit forc arrang   that cannot accommod   notion of univers valu     social also set the stage for populist promis   of take from one   group to support anoth this varieti of polit   postur by
