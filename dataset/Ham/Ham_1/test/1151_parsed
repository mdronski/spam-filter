 robert harley write   then consid a popul of number number men each   off with number women then number man let call him "wilt"   has sex with the other number women   this has never happen it relev is nil it was a extrem contriv exampl becaus you glosd over the point of the earlier number exampl but ok mr math let it be n men and women for ani number they all pair off then some number h number of men has sex with all the other number women he hasn't yet had sex with pick ani n and h that might be interest ani choic of valu result in meaning differ between the sex "promiscuity" as common understood it should be more obvious with extrem choic of number but it is also true for ani choic of n and h if unrealist total distract you further and i was hope this would be clear without say so outright this model actual approxim the clich "common wisdom" about per-gend sexual behavior if you revers the male and femal role those stereotyp are that more men than women seek multipl partner -- men be "more promiscuous" than women -- and that surplus of male interest is satisfi by a smaller number of hyperpromiscu women (often deris label "sluts")  so i chose not to type "on average" explicit in my post sinc this  is fork and one tend to assum that peopl have a clue   there is no disagr between us except that i am more interest  in typic behaviour and you in extrem nope now you'v amend the mean of your initi statement to make it more defens what i object to was robert harley #  assumpt that femal of all speci tend to be less promiscu #  male simpli doe not fit the fact hrdi contend # # well duh!! # # it is perfect obvious that (heterosexual) promiscu is exact # precis ident between male and femal # # of cours the shape of the distribut may differ if you assum peopl on fork had a clue would you have need to jump in with a patron "duh!!" if you were talk about fuzzi typic behavior would you have huf and puf with the word "perfect obvious" and "exact precis identical" if your concern was with the "typical" whi didn't you adopt the typic definit of "promiscuous" rather than a straw-man definit which allow you to interject "duh!!" and mock an anthrolopolog professor conclus  actual you probabl just  had a bad day and felt like jump down my throat for the hell of it you are welcom to that theori but here an altern theori when you jump in with a patron and overblown pronounc -- e.g "duh!!.. perfect obvious.. exact precis identical..." -- and that pronounc is itself sloppi and erron then other may get a kick out of pop your balloon - gordon
