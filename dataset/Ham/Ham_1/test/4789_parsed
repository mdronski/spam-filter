 hello bill monday septemb number number number pm you wrote   i don't think free speech is a licens to speak direct at  and be in the   physic presenc of ani particular individu of your  choos - especi   when that individu is busi do someth els and isn't  interest  yep i agre percent   sure and that goe back to my second argument -- cohen they can  walk away nobodi compel them to stand there i'll agre fulli  but we still have a constitut right to speak out against  polici action and grievanc   again if you want it anoth way let chang the constitut  huh are you say that whoever has the loudest voic get to be heard  shout down a public speaker could be consid a form of censorship if  shout down public speaker is protect it is onli a matter of time  befor the peopl do the shout have their tactic use against  them -everi singl time they open their mouth- the tactic is stupid and  non-product and if general use will onli result in chao the tactic  is just stupid ego-b at best unless the goal is to generat chao  and human whose goal and action in life are to creat chao in societi  should be lock up (provid you can accur identifi them which is not  realli possibl anyway but hey this is my rant :-) imho  bill no offens or anyth but there a differ between hold a sign that doesn't agre with bush and scream at him my sole point as far as the number amend goe is that there is more to this game than just be an angri liber youth (which is the gross culmin of everyon argument sofar) the scream isn't the most effect method around i don't believ i argu that it was but scream is happen becaus the mean to communic to the repres involv are diminish at least as far as the peopl do the scream are concern for the record i don't support the screamer in organ confer (such as the colin powel shout-down that was mention earlier) i don't think that this is what the number amend was impli these folk -do- have a right to be heard and i think they have a right to be heard by the folk they elect in the first place my point (mi onli point) was realli more concern with the case such as mr nell he wasn't engag (at least from the limit fact we have) in a shoutout but rather in a differ of opinion he has a right to possess this opinion and make it known to the repres that are elect a sign is not a shout-out i think i may have miss (or not accur addressed) the origin thread switch that took this exampl and mix in the scream dissent to the mix i was most respond with my miffed in have broad-brush stroke appli to a group without examin the polici reason that might have contribut to it in this case the scream parti are fed up with get corral mile away from the folk they need to speak with they'r resort to creativ offens and constitut challeng mean but it not simpli due to the fact that they'r number and have lost all decorum the my generat never did this ' is all bs there more to this stori we just dont know it all i hope this clarifi my posit for the quick rehash scream != free speech on all case dissent = free speech provid you follow what has been laid down by the suprem k -- best regard bitbitch email
