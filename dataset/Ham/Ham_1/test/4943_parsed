hack to weed out sequenc number for messag that don't exist  foreach m dollar {  if ![file exist dollar {  exmh_debug dollar not found  set ix [lsearch dollar dollar  set seq [lreplac dollar dollar dollar  } els {  # real hack  break  }  }   which is go to run slow if a sequenc happen to start with a bunch  of messag that don't exist i'm not sure whi it is import that the  first messag in the sequenc return exist but not necessarili ani  of the other but i'm sure glad it is as mhseqexpand get call lot  and i don't know if i could cope if it were check everi file in the  sequenc it is look at all the time.. although my fingerprint are all over that it not actual my code and has been in there sinc befor number (it code that i move from mh.tcl to sequences.tcl and back again) i'm number sure either but it should be a one-tim penalti becaus the sequenc will be re-written with the bad messag remov (i think.)  it may help to keep a list of the valid messag number for the current  folder (though that would then need to be verifi against chang to the  directory) doe tcl have a directori read function i assum so..   mh_sequenc also goe and reread the file (.mh_sequenc and the  context file) but i'm not sure how frequent that one is call that *was* a problem but if you look at mh_sequenc (and mh_sequenc and mh_sequenceupdate) they all call mhreadseq to do the actual read and it onli read the sequenc if the file has been touch look for the "exmh_debug read dollar output in the debug log to see when sequenc are actual reread from disk my theori is that ftoc_showsequ is be call too often i'm about to investig that   i'll email anyth i figur out sinc i'm leav town in less   than number hour   have a good vacat thank chris -- chris garrigu URL vircio URL number congress suit number austin tx number number number number number world war iii the wrong-doer vs the evil-do number content-typ application/pgp-signatur -----begin pgp signature----- version gnupg number (gnu/linux) comment exmh version number number number number number -----end pgp signature----- number _______________________________________________ exmh-work mail list email URL
