 [tim]  one effect of get rid of mincount is that it latch on more  strong to rare clue now and those can be uniqu to the corpus  train on (e.g. one train ham say "gryndlplyx!" and a followup  new ham quot it) this may be a systemat bias in the test procedur in real life msgs come order in time say there a thread that span n messag on c.l.pi in our test setup we'll train on a random sampl throughout it whole lifetim and test likewis new ham "in the middle" of this thread get benefit from that we train on msgs that appear both befor and *after* it in real life it quit plausibl that the f-p rate would rise without this effect in real life at ani given time some number of ham thread will just be start their live and if they'r at all unusu the train data will know littl to noth about them
