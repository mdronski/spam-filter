  quicki for shell scripter  how do i find out the time a file was creat at there is no canon test and the inform is not necessarili avail if you check out how struct stat is defin on your system you'll find that onli time_t st_atim /* time of last access */ time_t st_mtime /* time of last data modif */ time_t st_ctime /* time of last file status chang */ /* time measur in second sinc */ /* number utc jan number number */ are avail file status chang = i-nod status chang it includ creation mode chang ownership chang etc. so this is what you want onli if the file status wasn't chang sinc creation this inform is also shown by ls -lc but pars ls output requir a bit of effort i'd rather recommend to write a short c program to access the file status direct and output the ctime direct (second sinc the epoch i.e perfect for numer comparison) (anoth way is to use gnu find -printf with a custom format .. percent file last status chang time in the format return by the c `ctime function ...) -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
