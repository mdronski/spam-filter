 [skip]  hmmm how about you creat empti number stuff all your  file into a data/ham/reservoir folder then run the rebal.pi script to  random parcel messag out to the various real directori i'm afraid rebal is quadratic-tim in the # of msgs it shuffl around -- sinc it was onli intend to move a few file around it dead simpl an easi thing is to start the same way move all the file into a singl directori then do random.shuffle() on an os.listdir() of that directori then it trivial to split the result into n slice and move the file into n other directori accord  i suspect you can pull the same stunt for your data/spam stuff yup
