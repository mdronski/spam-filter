 neil train a classifi use number set with about number ham and spam in each we'r miss half his test run result due to a cmp.pi bug (sinc fixed) the "befor custom fiddling" figur on the number report run were fals posit percentag number number number total uniqu fp number fals negat percentag number number number total uniqu fn number the "total unique" figur count all number run it just the individual-run fp and fn percentag we'r miss for number run jeremi report these "befor custom fiddling" figur on number set with about number ham and spam in each fals posit percentag number number number number number number number number number number number number total uniqu fp number fals negat percentag number number number number number number number number number number number number total uniqu fn number so thing are clear work much better for neil both report signific improv in both f-n and f-p rate by fold in more header line neal ad receiv analysi to the base token header analysi and jeremi skip the base token header analysi complet but ad base-subject-line-lik but case-fold token for almost all header line (except onli receiv data x-from_ and i *suspect* all those start with x-vm') when i tri number random pair of number + number subset in my test data i see fals posit percentag number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number total uniqu fp number fals negat percentag number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number number total uniqu fn number this is much closer to what neil saw but still look better anoth run on a disjoint number random pair look much the same total uniqu fp rose to number and fn fell to number on a third run with anoth set of disjoint number random pair likewis with fp number and fn number so i'm pretti confid that it not go to matter which random subset of number i take from my data it hard to conclud anyth given jeremi much wors result if they were in line with neil result i'd suspect that i'v over-tun the algorithm to statist quirk in my corpora
