   if you'r use a break or similar construct in a while loop  then you might   want to rethink your guard condit   good point i didn't think of that howev that doesn't help with a  case statement which imho is cleaner than use an if statement if you  have a lot of branches.. but then again mayb that should be refactor  away with polymorph :) well you should consid break insid a select statement to be part of the syntax rather than a control flow modifi a _mandatory_ part of the syntax at that later kenn -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
