 on wed jul number number at number number brian foster wrote  xim general work as a complex compos frontend i.e. you  build up your charact as a seri of compos of the root or  fundament stroke ("radicals" i think they are called) and  then "commit" the composit charact to the applic  ( yes keyboard these script _is_ quit slow i believ  a good typist can onli do a few charact a minut  and i assum use a qwerti keyboard is veri pain ) i can speak for some chines input method and you can do a hell of a lot better than a few char per minut for exampl the simplest chines im is pinyin where you phonet spell out each charact use the pinyin romanis rule for exampl zhong guo (chines for china) is enter by type zhong then you'r prompt with a list of possibl match with the most common first in a number list so you hit say number for the second in the list then similar for guo number you can see that regard keystrok count it not that much differ to english howev until you get familiar with the sort order in the possibl match list it can be a littl slow other input method are more keystroke-effici lose the phonet simplic of pinyin chines charact are almost alway pronounc as a first-part-second-part so zhong is zh'-'ong one input method assign singl letter to the possibl first and second part so i might repres zh as a first part and ong as a second part so you'd enter zhong as ii and a digit to choos from the possibl match i think the microsoft global ime has a stroke mode where you can build up a charact stroke by stroke but you'd onli use that when you know the charact you want but you don't know how to pronounc it   some xim compos "in place" other do it on a special line  and some seem to do it in a special window (or the root?)  also some(/most?) xim appar support a us-ascii input  mode as well --- _not_ a general latin-alphabet input mode  which seem to requir anoth tla call kbd and which  appar doesn't work when an xim is also be use ---  impli you have to switch back and forth between us-ascii  input mode (what us english-speak would call "normal"  keyboarding/typing) and the other input (e.g. chinese)  i'm not sure but i have the impress the switch is often  a toggl and someth like  probabl most often ctrl-space that what the microsoft global input method editor use and what xcin use iirc regard the origin poster question - here what work for me on red hat number o make sure the xcin and ttfonts-zh_cn rpms are instal (the font might not be essenti i think xfree come with usuabl chines font in the number rpms o select chines (simplified) as the languag in gdm when log in everyth should just work if you'v got the default clock in your gnome panel you should now see it in chines a lot of the menus will also be in chines but you should be abl to find your way around use ctrl-space to toggl between chines and english input when in chines mode shift-spac toggl between someth that i don't understand but it block exit to english so if you can't use ctrl-space to get back to english tri hit shift-spac ctrl-space fire up a gnome termin in chines mode type zhong number guo number and you'll see the chines for china get this to work while select english at the gdm screen is left as an exercis for the reader look at number and /usr/share/doc/xcin should give enough info later kenn -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
