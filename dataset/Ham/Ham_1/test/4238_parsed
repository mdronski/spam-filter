 on mon number at number matthia saou wrote  i'v never heard of ani cd-rom or dvd-rom drive have problem with dma..  although there probabl is sinc red hat decid to default disabl it a  few releas back :-/ heh i get to see bad cdrom problem all the time most when vendor buy crap cabl to tri to save number but there are chipset and drive with known dma issu as well  normal even if you tri to enabl dma and your devic doesn't support it  it simpli don't be abl to make the chang and that it the problem iirc  is with crappi hardwar that is suppos to support dma but doesn't work as  expect when it enabled.. mayb chris could confirm this ;-) usual if you enabl dma on a cdrom that can't handl it grace you won't be abl to read data off it relabl and that about it no end_of_the_world problem and easili fix  i guess i'll settl for the /dev/dvd link chang as describ and put  the dma tip in the percent :-) my biggest beef with automat set /dev/dvd is that i alway seem to have a cd-burner and a dvd drive (or dvd burner) in the same box and i usual have the dvd as the second drive number in "kudzu-speak" i agre that the percent is the best place for the tip unless someon can come up with a way to probe cd/dvd drive to divulg their largest support media size without load ide-scsi or have that media current in the drive -- chris kloiber _______________________________________________ rpm-list mail list email URL
