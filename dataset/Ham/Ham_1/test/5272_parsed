 onc upon a time joshua wrote   just a thought would it be possibl to general this alsa  stuff to make build a kernel with *any* custom/optional/upd  modul an easi thing i think some script or at least step-by-step  instruct would be great   for exampl to build a kernel rpm with alsa do  number get the kernel sourc  number get the alsa sourc  number run the custom-kernel.sh script  ..   or a kernel rpm with the lastest wireless lan driver  number get the kernel sourc  number get the cvs driver sourc  number run the custom-kernel.sh script  ..   etc this wouldn't be worth the effort involv imho and would probabl end up in relat breakag of a few system if not care test your first exampl is a good one becaus i realli think it even easier current  number leav your current kernel as-i number get the "alsa-driver" sourc rpm number rebuild and instal result packag driver that are written to be easili compil as modul (like ltmodem nvidia alsa etc.) can easili be repackag separ as rpms and port as easili for various kernel rpms from the sourc rpm also what you describ is sort of the opposit of what rpm packag is in my mind i see it more as a "one size fit all" achiev in the general case and kernel isn't an except (although there are packag optim for various processors) sinc they all come with just about all the modul you'll ever need make that "one size fit many" then if you want ;-) last but not least  the kernel is someth i'm tri to keep away from in my packag sinc i realli don't want to see newbi screw up their system becaus of packag on my website.. same goe for gnome kde and other major bit of the distribut sinc i also want peopl who happili use my packag to be abl to upgrad to the next red hat linux releas without have their system turn into anoth ximian mess matthia ps yes chris i'm worri about not give you too much work less in fact sinc you can easili answer "freshrpms.net!" to peopl ask how to play dvds right ;-)))) -- matthia saou world trade center ------------- edificio nort number planta system and network engin number barcelona spain electron group interact phone  number number number number number _______________________________________________ rpm-list mail list email URL
