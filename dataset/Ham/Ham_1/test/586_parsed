  interest i'v alway wonder about thing consid to be bad  exampl the goto most languag support a goto of some sort so are goto realli bad oh goodi my final year project rear it head :-)  is a loop or a recurs call actual ani better than a goto  or is the goto use as a kind of common enemi of  program syntax much as i would like to answer an unqualifi "yes" i must admit if you alreadi code in a style that make heavi use of goto code in the same style with gosub or function call doe not improv code much the same as when the manual on "modular coding" said to write modul that would fit on a singl sheet of comput paper lot of coder proceed to split their code into arbitrari number chunk :) howev "go-to consid harmful" point out that to analys (==debug) code you need to be abl to tell what the point of execut is and what the valu of the variabl are at that point this is an easy(tm) job if the code use assign if() for() and function but not if it use goto (see number for the full letter) despit be one of dijkstra brain-damag children who learn basic at an earli age :) i never use goto anymor (or ani of it bastard offspr like break continu fudg function call with sleight of hand in the variables) my code is longer than it might be if i had use goto at a critic handi point howev code is a bit like network - you alway end up ad bit on where you didn't expect to - and the benefit is felt when anoth person (like myself but in three month time) is modifi or debug it and doesn't have to go through the hassl of deal with the impact of the goto dave -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
