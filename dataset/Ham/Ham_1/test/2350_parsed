---------------------------------------------------------------- number get down to some serious work by john fontana network world number just a few year remov from the mayhem of music swap that clog corpor network peer-to-p technolog is grow up and rediscov it root as a legitim concept for distribut comput in corpor environ and the internet the turnaround is distinct sinc number has distanc itself from the darl day of napster and has been transplant onto the architectur draw board of internet and corpor network gurus for network execut the about-fac is show up in such discret place as wireless rout ident manag web servic and grid comput number has prove it worth - albeit with a few wart - in enterpris collabor and content manag applic but it brightest futur may be in the plumb of corpor distribut comput but even as number fade into the background question around secur standard and qualiti of servic still have to be answer befor number can flourish expert say the number evolut regardless number evolut has hit it next stage "peer-to-p is an architectur and one that will play a substanti role in distribut comput as endpoint in the network gain more power," say jami lewi ceo and research chair of burton group he say that will be particular import for web servic as peer share process and data number will becom a fundament part of how distribut comput evolv across the internet and how enterpris build distribut system internally." lewi say the internet today is veri rudimentari with it basic protocol for basic oper "now we'r serious talk about the network becom the comput incorpor some number connect and be abl to share process and power which is what grid comput provides." observ say it a renaiss number revert to an architectur that can be appli to solv problem that by their veri natur are distributed," say neil macehit senior consult for ovum a research and consult firm "but the question is can this model provid benefit for busi use." macehit say it can but he caution that secur such as remov block to number traffic on corpor firewal is still a major inhibitor to accept "but you can imagin someth like grid extend to share applic logic instead of just be a data grid or a storag grid when you look at web servic share busi logic in the enterpris you see the intersect with grid and number he say work togeth to underscor number evolut the global grid forum (ggf) a number group found by academ and research merg in april with the number work group origin found by intel the group are attempt to marri the ggf work on har server on a grid with number abil to connect desktop "we'r now tri to figur out how grid and number play nice togeth and captur that power for use in enterpris computing," say andrew chien co-director of the ggf peer-to-p area and cto of entropia a provid of desktop grid applic late last month the merg group began evalu how number relat to the open grid servic architectur an effort to standard grid comput chien say his group is explor how number protocol for such thing as registr resourc discoveri and coordin of data transfer support a common grid infrastructur and number root are reach into other area it is an integr part of mobil wireless technolog set for releas this fall by meshnetwork the compani meshlan softwar extend the rang of number wireless network by make everi wireless peer an endpoint in an ad-hoc number network and also a router/repeat to channel traffic to other peer use a patent multihop technolog peer that are out of rang of wireless access point or peer they wish to communic with can hop through other peer to reach their destin includ corpor lan it not onli increas the wireless rang it preserv throughput which is up to number megabit the technolog also is mobil let hop take place from node travel in vehicl up to number mph number allow us to do the hop and our algorithm allow the traffic to pick the most effici path to travel," say rick rotondo vice presid of disrupt technolog for meshnetwork "the beauti of a number network is that it is self-form and self-healing." and the technolog is matur the defens advanc research project agenc (darpa) which creat the internet spent number million develop the peer technolog for use in form instant network among soldier on a battlefield meshnetwork licens it from darpa has spent an addit number million to creat a commerci product number also is key to the pingid project to creat an ident manag system similar to work under way by microsoft and the liberti allianc project which are not use number "ideal you need a way to creat manag and exchang digit ident inform with no one in the middl of the transaction," say andr duran founder of the project he say that number but it just one part of the equat "your id is a virtual privat vault with differ drawers," duran say "one drawer may be on your pc one may be with a servic provid and you need a client to manag all that we are build the infrastructur to support that." ping id is work on server and client softwar that act like a mini-web server and maintain a repositori of user ident inform user have the option of exchang id direct through number or use client/serv technolog to author a third parti to dispens their ident data number provid a level of control that other architectur don't," duran say "it come down to the fact that some applic are more effici with number that is the concept that is drive number into so mani differ area of comput number has evolv from someth high disrupt to someth complementari to intranet extranet mobil user and all the web integration," say greg bolcer cto of endeavor technolog which develop a number collabor softwar call magi and although number is still settl into this new role it obvious that it reput as a music-swap corpor scourg are now well behind it copyright number network world inc all right reserv ---------------------------------------------------------------- sent by geeg email
