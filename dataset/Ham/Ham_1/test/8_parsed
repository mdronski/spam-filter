i read all of my outstand mail befor i  tri this new exmh ..   second i'v been use to have a key bind which was to msg_markunseen  which doesn't seem to exist ani more and i'm not sure what i should replac  e  that with there obvious a way as the "sequences" menu doe this  the "mark unseen" menu entri in the messag "more" menu is still want  that function as well..    for those who have other sequenc defin the window will widen to   display the other sequenc   ani chanc of have that lengthen instead i like all my exmh stuff  in nice column (fit the display better) that is i use the detach  folder list one column the main exmh window take up full screen  top to bottom but less than half the width etc..   i have space for more sequenc in the "unseen" window as long as they  remain onc nice narrow window (best would be if the sequenc could be  order by some prefer then one which didn't fit would just fall  off the bottom and not be shown)   i'd also prefer it if that window had no unusu background colour  just one constant colour - i have been run the unseen window with  background black on a root window that is all black with no border or  other decor but made "sticky" - the appear is just like the  folder with unseen messag (and their counts) are written into the  root window (becaus it is sticki this small display follow me around  and do i can see when new mail need processing)   i also find that i tend to have a bunch of sequenc that onli ever occur  in one folder (some i had forgotten i ever created) so in addit to  the "sequenc to alway show" and "sequenc to never show" a  prefer to onli show sequenc that occur in more than one folder  would be use and then have the sequenc that occor onli in the  folder i'm visit appear in the list when that folder is current  this is just to keep the list size somewhat manag while remain  product (i quit often use a sequenc to rememb a particular messag  in a folder - the name is use onli there and onli for one messag  it give me a handl on the messag which remain as the folder is  pack sort etc)   i haven't updat my exmh for some time now so i'm not sure if this  next one is new or just new sinc number but the sequenc menu (on the  bar with new flist search ...) onli contain "unseen" and "urgent"  it would be use if it contain all of the sequenc that the folder  happen to have defin a "new sequence" entri would also be use  (to mark the messag with a sequenc name that didn't previous exist  which can be done now use "search" and the pick interfac but is  clumsi that way)   actual you onc could now when i tri this enter a sequenc name  in the pick box and a singl messag number or a rang n-n in the  list of messag and no pick attribut at all i now get ..   syntax error in express number number  while execut  "expr number  dollar  (procedur "ftoc_findmsg" line number  invok from within  "ftoc_findmsg dollar  (procedur "ftoc_findmsgs" line number  invok from within  "ftoc_findmsg dollar  (procedur "ftoc_pickmsgs" line number  invok from within  "ftoc_pickmsg dollar dollar  (procedur "pickinner" line number  invok from within  "pickinn {exec pick +inbox -list} number -sequenc mercury}"  ("uplevel" bodi line number  invok from within  "uplevel number dollar  (procedur "busycursorinner" line number  invok from within  "busycursorinn dollar dollar  (procedur "busycursorhack" line number  invok from within  "busycursorhack dollar  ("cursor" arm line number  invok from within  "switch dollar {  icon {busyicon dollar  cursoral {busycursor dollar  cursor {busycursorhack dollar  default {eval dollar  }"  (procedur "busy" line number  invok from within  "busi pickinn dollar dollar  (procedur "pick_it" line number  invok from within  "pick_it"  invok from within  ".pick.but.pick invoke"  ("uplevel" bodi line number  invok from within  "uplevel number [list dollar invoke]"  (procedur "tkbuttonup" line number  invok from within  "tkbuttonup .pick.but.pick  "  (command bound to event)   it has been age sinc i did this last though i tri ad a subject  to pick on (easi as i know what in the message...) which made no differen  ce  look as if someth is now say number hit" when befor it didn't or  similar    i'v also chang the ftoc color as discuss briefli on the lis  t a   week or so ago   ani chanc of make the current messag a littl brighter background  just to make it stand out a fraction more than it doe (mayb this is  more appar to me than mani as i use veri small font everywher  the background of the ftoc line isn't veri wide)   hope this help   kre     _______________________________________________  exmh-work mail list  email  URL -- chris garrigu URL vircio URL number congress suit number austin tx number number number number number world war iii the wrong-doer vs the evil-do number content-typ application/pgp-signatur -----begin pgp signature----- version gnupg number (gnu/linux) comment exmh version number number number number =coew -----end pgp signature----- number _______________________________________________ exmh-work mail list email URL
