 date wed number sep number number number from brent welch email message-id email  exmh has a funki cut/past model that is essenti all my fault  the middl click set the insert point if you hate that go to the  bindings.. simpl edit prefer window and de-select  "past set insert" unfortun the side effect of that solut is that it is no longer possibl to cut/past within one sedit window some intermedi client alway must be use (except in the rare case where you want to select some text and then past it at the same place) that becaus the click that you have to (with this option) make to set the insert point also kill the select (it end up revert to the last select made in some other window or someth like that) so the vast major of peopl probabl want that "past set insert" enabl - that one you can learn to live with the other is much more pain kre _______________________________________________ exmh-us mail list email URL
