 -----origin message----- from email email behalf of robert harley sent monday septemb number number number am to email subject re java is for kiddi reza b'far wrote  thread kind of surpris me.. i start code with c then c++ and  on to java.. and i think that robert harley wrote  like a case of "mi experi is comprehens your is  they don't know what they'r talk about" well i sure don't claim that.. i think most peopl on fork probabl have more program knowledg than i do.. there lot of experi out here.. reza b'far wrote number the peopl who pay the wage don't give a flyin heck what program  you write thing in.. they just want it to work robert harley wrote  my experi they do care it has to work certain and in  it has to work with what they'v alreadi got and it has to  on client system  limit experi of java start a few year ago when support on  was so terribl that i ran away scream and haven't come back yet well i think until recent support for most thing on linux was kind of shady.. thing have got much better.. you'r right in that the jdk use to suck on linux.. but then imho linux is still maturing... or at least develop tool for linux are maturing.. i'v been develop a few server side app that run on linux recent with jdk number and they'v had no problem with great perform robert harley wort  has announc that they plan to remov java from window  took it out of xp alreadi and it has to be instal with a  pack somehow i can't imagin them remov the abil to  c program hmmm.. do you realli think that ms is pull out java becaus it a "bad" program languag or applic platform you don't think this has anyth to do with .net be a competitor to java do you or that ms has basic copi java (with some addit features) and call it c# isn't that alon an indic that they actual do think that a vm is the right way to go for most high level applic reza b'far wrote number c and c++ forc the develop to solv problem such as memori  over and over again robert harley wrote  say i spend ani notic amount of time on memori manag  apart from the fact that i frequent need  number gb hmmm again... you'r tell me that you'v never had a nasti bug that took you a coupl of day to track down that had to do with a memori leak i am not the best c/c++ programmer.. not even close.. but i'v known realli good ones.. and even they have nasti bug that have to do with memori manag howev occasion they may be  about design pattern architectur high level stuff.. robert harley wrote  your problem just requir applic of a "design pattern" to solv  it trivial anyway irrespect of languag wow so you'r tell me that unless the applic involv bit-count it trivial what about the applic itself what about high level problem such as task distribut work-flow etc. aren't most high level problem solv with high level solut like design pattern or do you solv high level problem by write optim c/c++ code for exampl do you think that most peopl work on collabor framework (there are lot of them on this list) are work on write an oper system with assembl that provid for a collabor environ  am amaz by the amount of time wast by peopl talk about low  problem that have been solv number million time over and over  over again.. robert harley wrote  appear to be gratuit assert that c programm wast time  irrelev low-level problem and java programm don't depend  on the programm not the languag i can see how you could infer this howev what i believ to realli be the case is that java is one of the best languag for write larg applic with mani compon that involv the collabor of more than three programm in those case it alway veri hard to get the programm to agre on api memori manag techniqu etc with java the jcp take care of the discuss so that you don't sit around in a long meet tri to decid what api to use to hook up to a databas (jdbc) or a messag bus (jms) number java is not just a program languag it also a platform.. robert harley wrote  yike have you written db code with c/c++ for differ databas (just an example) tri port a persist layer from window to unix say you have informix run on solari and you want to port to window with ms sql (bad idea...but for the sake of the example) would you rather deal with jdbc port or c/c++ port that use informix driver and now you have to use odbc  monolith set of api or a crap load of differ api slice  dice the same problem number differ way robert harley wrote  assert so are you say that there is a standard set of api for c/c++ for everyth (asid to the minim ansi stuff) is there a standard way of deal with c/c++ applic for various domain problem (messag databas persist etc.) that rival java i'd like to know if there is one accept by everyon who write c/c++.. in that case i claim ignorance.. not suggest that java is the golden hammer... just that c/c++ is overkil for most things.. i even code in vb.. but vb is a true disgrac to programming.. it just lame.. java is object oriented.. (no flame-mail from the anti-oo peopl please.. that is a religi discussion...) and relat clean.. and i don't think that everi "kid" can write a well design java program kid typic don't understand various design pattern and principles.. to my experi they actual tend to think more of the low level problem want to rewrit and reinvent the world.. a tendenc that is much more possibl imho in c/c++ than in java due to exist of standard api
