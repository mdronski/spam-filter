 onc upon a time mark wrote   i rememb apt-get dist-upgrad from number to number fine so it -should-  work mayb :) i'v done that too on mani product server the onli littl (unimportant) catch is to replac "kernel-headers" by "glibc-kernheaders" a simpl "apt-get instal glibc-kernheaders" take care of that upgrad between releas is meant to work not between beta or beta and releas the reason is simpl  some packag may have been downgrad some other may have been rebuilt with the same version but differ depend for both these categori of packag the upgrad through apt/rhn/whatev just won't do as some older packag might be consid as the newest thus be kept on the system as red hat doe i realli don't recommend tri to upgrad between beta or from a beta to a final releas either simpli backup your /home /etc (and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstal clean it'll probabl save a few hassl and you'll get the cleanest possibl system ;-) matthia -- matthia saou world trade center ------------- edificio nort number planta system and network engin number barcelona spain electron group interact phone  number number number number number _______________________________________________ rpm-list mail list email URL
