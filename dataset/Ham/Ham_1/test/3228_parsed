 i think that when consid deploy a solut that support all python platform and not just the  crowd is desir mac and pc user are more apt to be use a commerci mua that unlik to offer hook abil (at least not easily) as mention elsewher even  user may find an mua solut easier to use then get it ad to their mta (sysop make programm look like flame liber ;).) my notion of a solut for windows/outlook has been as guido describ a client-serv client side doe number fetch (of which i'm onli go to implement number initially) potenti on sever host spamham the incom mail and put it into one file per messag (qmail style?) the mua access this "ethunk" as a server to obtain all the ham spam is retain in the ethunk and a simpl viewer would be use for manual oversight on the spam for ultim reject (and train of spam filter) and the ham will go forward (after be use for training) on the next mua fetch ethunk would sit on a timer for alway onlin user but i am not clear on how to support dialup user with this scheme outbound mail would use a direct path from the mua to the mta hope all mua can split the host fetch/send url imo end user are like to be more intest in n-way classif if this is avail the "simpl viewer" could be enhanc to support view via folder and (at least for me) the outlook nightmar is over - i would use this as my onli mua (n.b accord to my recent read the best n-way classifi use someth call a "support vector machine" (svm) which is percent more accur then naiv bay (nb) ) i wonder if the focus of spambay ought not to be a classifi that leav the fetch and feed of messag to auxillari code that way it could be drop into whatev har that suit the user situat david leblanc seattl wa usa
