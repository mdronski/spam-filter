experiment design it is interest that number they use an all-femal panel and number they includ a mix of age from number and number they use human confeder comput as well as imit the last two paragraph are a rare sign of editori humor by an ny time bylin writer even still note the veri larg fig leaf -- the ceo joke is introduc in an on-the-record quot not that we'r talk about anyth near as color as the economist :-) rk email whi we'r so nice we'r wire to cooper juli number number by natali angier what feel as good as chocol on the tongu or money in the bank but won't make you fat or risk a subpoena from the secur and exchang commiss hard as it may be to believ in these day of infecti greed and saber unsheath scientist have discov that the small brave act of cooper with anoth person of choos trust over cynic generos over selfish make the brain light up with quiet joy studi neural activ in young women who were play a classic laboratori game call the prison dilemma in which particip can select from a number of greedi or cooper strategi as they pursu financi gain research found that when the women chose mutual over "me-ism," the mental circuitri normal associ with reward-seek behavior swell to life and the longer the women engag in a cooper strategi the more strong flow the blood to the pathway of pleasur the research perform their work at emori univers in atlanta use magnet reson imag to take what might be call portrait of the brain on hug "the result were realli surpris to us," said dr gregori s bern a psychiatrist and an author on the new report which appear in the current issu of the journal neuron "we went in expect the opposite." the research had thought that the biggest respons would occur in case where one person cooper and the other defect when the cooper might feel that she was be treat unjust instead the brightest signal aros in cooper allianc and in those neighborhood of the brain alreadi known to respond to dessert pictur of pretti face money cocain and ani number of licit or illicit delight "it reassuring," dr bern said "in some way it say that we'r wire to cooper with each other." the studi is among the first to use m.r.i technolog to examin social interact in real time as oppos to take brain imag while subject stare at static pictur or thought-prescrib thought it is also a novel approach to explor an ancient conundrum whi are human so well nice whi are they will to cooper with peopl whom they bare know and to do good deed and to play fair a surpris high percentag of the time scientist have no troubl explain the evolut of competit behavior but the depth and breadth of human altruism the willing to forgo immedi person gain for the long-term common good far exceed behavior seen even in other large-brain high social speci like chimpanze and dolphin and it has as such been difficult to understand "i'v point out to my student how impress it is that you can take a group of young men and women of prime reproduct age have them come into a classroom sit down and be perfect comfort and civil to each other," said dr peter j richerson a professor of environment scienc and polici at the univers of california at davi and an influenti theorist in the field of cultur evolut "if you put number male and number femal chimpanze that don't know each other into a lectur hall it would be a social explosion." dr ernst fehr of the univers of zurich and colleagu recent present find on the import of punish in maintain cooper behavior among human and the willing of peopl to punish those who commit crime or violat norm even when the chastis take risk and gain noth themselv while serv as ad hoc polic in her survey of the manag of so-cal common in small-scal communiti where villag have the right for exampl to graze livestock on common held land dr elinor ostrom of indiana univers found that all communiti have some form of monitor to gird against cheat or use more than a fair share of the resourc in laboratori game that mimic small-scal common dr richerson said number to number percent have to be coerc by a threat of punish to cooper fear alon is not high like to inspir cooper behavior to the degre observ among human if research like dr fehr show the stick side of the equat the newest find present the neural carrot - peopl cooper becaus it feel good to do it in the new find the research studi number women from number to number year old mani of them student at emori and inspir to particip by the promis of monetari reward the scientist chose an all-femal sampl becaus so few brain-imag studi have look at onli women most have been limit to men or to a mixtur of men and women but there is a vast bodi of non- imag data that reli on use the prison dilemma "it a simpl and eleg model for reciprocity," said dr jame k rill an author on the neuron paper who is at princeton "it been refer to as the e coli of social psychology."  past result the research said one can assum that neuro- imag studi of men play the game would be similar to their new find with women the basic structur of the trial had two women meet each other briefli ahead of time one was place in the scanner while the other remain outsid the scan room the two interact by comput play about number round of the game in everi round each player press a button to indic whether she would "cooperate" or "defect." her answer would be shown on-screen to the other player the monetari award were apport after each round if one player defect and the other cooper the defector earn number and the cooper noth if both chose to cooper each earn number if both opt to defect each earn number henc mutual cooper from start to finish was a far more profit strategi at number a woman than complet mutual defect which gave each number the risk that a woman took each time she becam greedi for a littl bit more was that the cooper strategi would fall apart and that both would emerg the poorer in some case both women were allow to pursu ani strategi that they chose in other case the non- scan woman would be a "confederate" with the research instruct unbeknown to the scan subject to defect after three consecut round of cooper the better to keep thing less rarefi and pretti and more lifelik and gritti in still other experi the woman in the scanner play a comput and knew that her partner was a machin in other test women play a comput but thought that it was a human the research found that as a rule the freeli strateg women cooper even occasion episod of defect whether from free strateg or confeder were not necessarili fatal to an allianc "the social bond could be reattain easili if the defector chose to cooper in the next coupl of rounds," anoth author of the report dr clinton d kilt said "although the one who had origin been `betray might be wari from then on." as a result of the episod defect the averag per-experi take for the particip was in the number "some pair though got lock into mutual defection," dr rill said analyz the scan the research found that in round of cooper two broad area of the brain were activ both rich in neuron abl to respond to dopamin the brain chemic fame for it role in addict behavior one is the anteroventr striatum in the middl of the brain right abov the spinal cord experi with rat have shown that when electrod are place in the striatum the anim will repeat press a bar to stimul the electrod appar receiv such pleasur feedback that they will starv to death rather than stop press the bar anoth region activ dure cooper was the orbitofront cortex in the region right abov the eye in addit to be part of the reward-process system dr rill said it is also involv in impuls control "everi round you'r confront with the possibl of get an extra dollar by defecting," he said "the choic to cooper requir impuls control." signific the reward circuitri of the women was consider less respons when they knew that they were play against a comput the thought of a human bond but not mere monetari gain was the sourc of content on display in concert with the imag result the women when ask afterward for summari of how they felt dure the game often describ feel good when they cooper and express posit feel of camaraderi toward their play partner assum that the urg to cooper is to some extent innat among human and reinforc by the brain feel-good circuitri the question of whi it aros remain unclear anthropologist have specul that it took teamwork for human ancestor to hunt larg game or gather difficult plant food or rear difficult children so the capac to cooper confer a surviv advantag on our forebear yet as with ani other trait the willing to abid by the golden rule and to be a good citizen and not cheat and steal from one neighbor is not uniform distribut "if we put some c.e.o. in here i'd like to see how they respond," dr kilt said "mayb they wouldn't find a posit social interact reward at all." a prison dilemma inde number how to advertis
