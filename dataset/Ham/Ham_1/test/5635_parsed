 hi everybodi i'm write a web applic in java (tomcat + jsp/servlet + databas access with postgresql) this will be releas under the gpl and will eventu be use as a framework for other web applic the applic main focus is e-commerc but not limit to that i would like to use some form of cryptographi to protect data on the databas but i have some problem figur out the right approach abov all how to store password and key in a share web server a problem that i was unabl to solv is how to store key for encryption/decrypt the api that i'm use is the jca number and the method of save generat key in keystor fail alway i can serial the object and store in the databas but this is not the most secur approach this key is need to decrypt data in the databas but the databas is access from the web applic assum that i can find a good and secur place where to store the databas password i can use a differ databas with differ user.. argh.. to complex and doesn't realli solv the problem where i can found good document about this topic there is anoth approach that i would share with the list someth i thought that can be of bit interest but probabili wrong and insecur after all i'm a real beginn in secur program and i'm here to learn method and technic first of all i need a secur way to keep databas password secur so i have to keep them separ from the main server the right approach could be use a small java bean applic that run as normal user (not tomcat so it is not share with other web servic or worst the nobodi user) that has no shell login but has a default home directori or a place where it can hold password and key the web applic could then open an ssl connect (could be done in the init method at server startup) to get databas password the small bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatev els that the sourc is the right one and handl all the databas connect or give the db connection/password to the main web applic in this way we solv the problem of keep the key and password in share directori and also an attack should get root/bean user account to read data this is not perfect and work onli if your provid give the opportun to configur a separ java applic (that mean realli anoth server run in the background) ani suggest thank you mario torr -- pleas avoid send me word or powerpoint attach see URL
