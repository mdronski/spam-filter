  i gave it all the thought it deserv  it would be  wonder to get sever peopl crank on the same test data and  i'm all in favor of that otoh my data/ subtre current has  more than number file slobber over number million byte -- even if  i had a place to put that much stuff i'm not sure my isp would let  me email it in one msg  do you have a dialup or someth more modern  number of messag zip would probabl compress pretti well - under number i'd guess with all the similar in the header and such you could zip each of the number set individu and upload them somewher  can you think of anyplac to get a larg shareabl ham sampl  apart from a public mail list everyon eager to share their  spam but spam is so much alik in so mani way that the easi  half of the data collect problem how about random sampl lot of public mail list via gmane or someth similar manual clean it (distribut that load over a number of people) and then reli on your clever code and your rebalanc script to help further cleans it the "problem" with the ham is it tend to be much more tie to one person (not just intim but unique) than the spam i save all incom email for ten day (gzip mbox format) befor it roll over and disappear at ani one time i think i have about number messag most of it isn't terribl person (which i would cull befor pass along anyway) and much of it is machine-gener so would be of margin use final it all ham-n-spam mix togeth do we call that an omelett or a denni grand slam skip
