 brian o'donoghu wrote a code fragment  number  {  some_thing_goes_here()   number  do_someth   } unfortun strlen is a relat expens oper if you are use c++ this is not such a big issu as string.length() can be declar const so long as you do not modifi the string object the compil can do the cach for you i do not think this is possibl in c though you could write the same code fragment as ============================ number { some_thing_goes_here() number do_something() } ============================ note my previous point if some_thing_goes_here() or do_something() are veri long function then there is no real need to optimis this code also for string manipul a much better approach would be ============================ char c char* p number { some_thing_goes_here() number do_something() } ============================ this work becaus c use number termin string it improv perform becaus you alway have a pointer to the charact instead of have to do array manipul strict speak the variabl c is not requir as most compil are smart enough to store *p in a regist the problem is that this use pointer arithmet which can make the code illeg if not manag care which is one of the reason i prefer java for most program task :) - matthew __________________________________________________ do you yahoo! everyth you'll ever need on one web page from news and sport to email and music chart URL -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
