 but i *like* corn. -------- origin messag -------- subject [interest] fwd when a crop becom king date fri number jul number number number (edt) from donald eastlak number email number juli number number when a crop becom king by michael pollan cornwal bridg conn -- here in southern new england the corn is alreadi waist high and grow so avid you can almost hear the creak of stalk and leaf as the plant stretch toward the sun the ear of sweet corn are just start to show up on local farm stand inaugur one of the ceremoni of an american summer these day the nation near number million-acr field of corn roll across the countrysid like a second great lawn but this wholesom all-american imag obscur a decid more dubious realiti like the tulip the appl and the potato zea may (the botan name for both sweet and feed corn) has evolv with human over the past number year or so in the great danc of speci we call domest the plant gratifi human need in exchang for which human expand the plant habitat move it gene all over the world and remak the land (clear tree plow the ground protect it from it enemies) so it might thrive corn by make itself tasti and nutriti got itself notic by christoph columbus who help expand it rang from the new world to europ and beyond today corn is the world most wide plant cereal crop but nowher have human done quit as much to advanc the interest of this plant as in north america where zea may has insinu itself into our landscap our food system and our feder budget one need look no further than the number billion farm bill presid bush sign last month to wonder whose interest are realli be serv here under the number program taxpay will pay farmer number billion a year to grow ever more corn this despit the fact that we struggl to get rid of the surplus the plant alreadi produc the averag bushel of corn number pounds) sell for about number today it cost farmer more than number to grow it but rather than design a program that would encourag farmer to plant less corn which would have the benefit of lift the price farmer receiv for it congress has decid instead to subsid corn by the bushel therebi insur that zea may dominion over it number mile american habitat will go unchalleng at first blush this subsidi might look like a handout for farmer but realli it a form of welfar for the plant itself -- and for all those econom interest that profit from it overproduct the processor factori farm and the soft drink and snack maker that reli on cheap corn for zea may has triumph by make itself indispens not to farmer (whom it is swift and sure bankrupting) but to the archer daniel midland tyson and coca-cola of the world our entir food suppli has undergon a process of "cornification" in recent year without our even notic it that becaus unlik in mexico where a corn-bas diet has been the norm for centuri in the unit state most of the corn we consum is invis have been heavili process or pass through food anim befor it reach us most of the anim we eat (chicken pig and cows) today subsist on a diet of corn regardless of whether it is good for them in the case of beef cattl which evolv to eat grass a corn diet wreak havoc on their digest system make it necessari to feed them antibiot to stave off ill and infect even farm-rais salmon are be bred to toler corn not a food their evolut has prepar them for whi feed fish corn becaus it the cheapest thing you can feed ani anim thank to feder subsidi but even with more than half of the number billion bushel of corn produc annual be fed to anim there is plenti left over so compani like a.d.m. cargil and conagra have figur ingeni new way to dispos of it turn it into everyth from ethanol to vitamin c and biodegrad plastic by far the best strategi for keep zea may in busi has been the develop of high-fructos corn syrup which has all but push sugar asid sinc the number most soft drink manufactur have switch from sugar to corn sweeten as have most snack maker near number percent of the calori american consum now come from corn sweeten the figur is number percent for mani children add to that all the corn-bas anim protein (corn-f beef chicken and pork) and the corn qua corn (chip muffin sweet corn) and you have a plant that has becom one of natur greatest success stori by turn us (along with sever other equal unwit species) into an expand race of corn eater so whi begrudg corn it phenomen success isn't this the way domest is suppos to work the problem in corn case is that we'r sacrif the health of both our bodi and the environ by grow and eat so much of it though we'r onli begin to understand what our cornifi food system is do to our health there caus for concern it probabl no coincid that the wholesal switch to corn sweeten in the number mark the begin of the epidem of obes and type number diabet in this countri sweet becam so cheap that soft drink maker rather than lower their price super-s their serv portion and market budget thousand of new sweeten snack food hit the market and the amount of fructos in our diet soar this would be bad enough for the american waistlin but there also preliminari research suggest that high-fructos corn syrup is metabol differ than other sugar make it potenti more harm a recent studi at the univers of minnesota found that a diet high in fructos (as compar to glucose) elev triglycerid level in men short after eat a phenomenon that has been link to an increas risk of obes and heart diseas littl is known about the health effect of eat anim that have themselv eaten so much corn but in the case of cattl research have found that corn-f beef is higher in satur fat than grass-f beef we know a lot more about what number million acr of corn is do to the health of our environ serious and last damag modern corn hybrid are the greediest of plant demand more nitrogen fertil than ani other crop corn requir more pesticid than ani other food crop runoff from these chemic find it way into the groundwat and in the midwestern corn belt into the mississippi river which carri it to the gulf of mexico where it has alreadi kill off marin life in a number squar mile area to produc the chemic we appli to our cornfield take vast amount of oil and natur gas (nitrogen fertil is made from natur gas pesticid from oil.) america corn crop might look like a sustain solar-pow system for produc food but it is actual a huge ineffici pollut machin that guzzl fossil fuel -- a half a gallon of it for everi bushel so it seem corn has inde becom king we have given it more of our land than ani other plant an area more than twice the size of new york state to keep it well fed and safe from predat we dous it with chemic that poison our water and deepen our depend on foreign oil and then in order to dispos of all the corn this crack system has produc we eat it as fast as we can in as mani way as we can turn the fat of the land into well fat one has to wonder whether corn hasn't at last succeed in domest us ====== michael pollan is the author most recent of "the botani of desir a plant's-ey view of the world."
