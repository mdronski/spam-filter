archiv earlier today.. rk email bigger bar code inch up on retail august number number by kate murphi in a littl more than two year retail in the unit state and canada will face a deadlin that promis technolog challeng akin to the year number comput problem start jan number number the number bar code retail use to identifi everyth from car to candi bar will go to number digit the addit number (and associ bar and spaces) is enough to make checkout scanner seiz up and make comput crash perhap disrupt entir suppli chain but mani retail have yet to focus on a problem that will requir signific invest in time and capit "most retail are public compani that tend to live quarter and not look ahead which mean they are go to be hit over the head with this and have to scrambl at the last minut to avert disaster," said thoma friedman presid of retail system research servic a compani in newton mass. that publish a retail inform technolog newslett lead retail say they have begun to address the issu a spokesman for wal-mart store the world largest retail said the compani had "embrac the concept" of an expand bar code but he did not respond to question about actual measur taken to prepar comput databas and logist system similar a spokesman for the target corpor said his compani was "intellectu ready" for the chang but refus to comment on whether ani of it store or warehous were technolog readi but richard a galanti the chief financi offic of costco wholesal admit "the truth is given the timelin everybodi still in the assess phase tri to figur out what to do." the difficulti is similar to the one pose by the year number comput problem when comput softwar had to be switch from two-digit entri identifi year to four-digit entri befor jan number number million of line of code had to be rewritten to avoid widespread comput failur bar code have been use in packag sinc number when the first item a pack of chew gum was scan at a supermarket in ohio the code identifi a product distinguish between an eight-ounc can of del mont cream corn and a medium-s pair of hane boxer short when a bar code is scan the inform in the store databas let the retail assign a price and track sale and inventori "the bar code is the linchpin upon which everyth in retail depends," mr friedman said the reason for expand the number bar code known as the univers product code is twofold first there is a shortag of u.p.c number "there onli a certain amount of number number and we'r go to run out," said john terwillig vice presid of global market at the univers code council a nonprofit organ base in lawrencevill n.j. that assign code in the unit state and canada second number bar code are use almost everywher els in the world the council european counterpart ean intern base in brussel assign these number call european articl number to compani in number nation "right now," mr terwillig said "foreign import have to get a number u.p.c to do busi over here which they haven't been too happi about." foreign manufactur current pass on to consum the cost of get an addit bar code and creat special label for product sold in the unit state and canada "it an ad expens for them and they have to recoup it somewhere," said debra shimkus market manag at the chicago import compani a specialti food import whose oversea supplier are often incredul when they are told they have to get new bar code for their product befor they can be sold in american groceri mani foreign manufactur decid that it is not worth the troubl "a lot of compani have been unwil to accept the addit burden," mr terwillig said "and have stay out of the market entirely." american and canadian export have not had the same obstacl becaus foreign retail can easili incorpor a number number into their number databas by make the first digit zero that is whi american and canadian manufactur of product that now have number code will not be affect by the code expans a two-lit bottl of coca-cola for exampl will keep the same u.p.c. but a zero will be ad to the begin of it bar-cod number in retail product databas "the effect of the chang in the u.p.c code fall squar on retailers," said mr friedman he estim that the upgrad will cost at least number million for a chain of number store with number checkout lane a store the expens will vari depend on the age of a retail databas softwar and hardwar and whether it has to hire outsid consult to make the chang scanner and other hardwar bought more than three year ago will not read longer code and will have to be replac softwar more than five year old will also have to be scrap "thank god we'd alreadi plan to buy new equip for a lot of store this year," said richard s gilbert director of store system at duan read a chain of number drugstor in new york citi the store have a total of number scan devic each cost number to number as for the cumbersom databas modif that need to be made mr gilbert said "our consult say they are work on it but they haven't gotten back to me with a plan i still don't know how big a deal it all go to be." he might want to ask john poss mr poss is the merchandis coordin for ace hardwar which has number store and sell some number code product ace overhaul it comput system to accept longer bar code in number the compani base in oak brook ill. has retail outlet in number countri and more than a hundr foreign supplier "it was such a struggl to get manufactur to relabel thing for north america," mr poss said "and we want the same system in place global so we decid to make the change." the compani hire a consult cogniz technolog solut which is base in teaneck n.j. and is a divis of dun & bradstreet ace in-hous team work on the project dure the day while a cogniz offic in india took over at night even so the project took almost two year to plan and carri out in addit to equip upgrad modif had to be made in more than number softwar program in various compani divis number in distribut alone) the most tedious and time-consum part of the convers mr poss said was make adjust to databas "everi databas in everi divis touch bar code inform and they all need to be reworked," he said "it like number where you had to go in and expand field and find everi refer to the date." though mr poss would not disclos the cost of the project he said the gain in effici and in supplier good will had been "well worth the expense." his advic to other retail is to "get busi becaus you'r face an extrem challenge." but move to number digit may not be enough the univers code council and ean intern which form an allianc in number strong advis manufactur and retail to go a step further and prepar their system to accommod a number code that is the length of a newli patent bar code that take up less space it reduc size mean that it can be affix to small item like loos produc and the extra digit let a retail keep track of addit data like batch and lot number that addit inform would make product recal easier "today," mr terwillig said "onc a product is taken out of the ship contain in the warehous you realli can't track it anymore." ship contain bar code are alreadi number digit the differ bar-cod standard mean that retail need differ comput system for ship and receiv inventori and sale by adopt a number standard retail should be abl to put all the inform into a singl databas mr poss said ace had ad the capac to scan and store number digit when it made it convers three year ago "now we can scan anything," he said "whether it in the warehous or at the regist and it immedi goe in to a central system no more send data between divisions." the cost and work of make the transit to number digit he said was the same as it would have been for a chang to number digit repres from the standard group said adopt a number structur - a step for which no date has been set - could help streamlin the share of data among all part of a retail oper it would also make it possibl they said to identifi product anywher in the world at ani time dure the trade process "and to think it all start with pack of gum," mr poss said number how to advertis --------------------------------- for inform on advertis in
