annual gross wage of about number billion or percent of the annual gross wage earn in the entir state some of the firm have reloc elsewher in the citi and region but mani have not new york citi is face a budget deficit without addit job the deficit may becom perman this is one reason for the import of rebuild if we do not replac the lost space lower manhattan never will regain the vibranc it had as the world financi center love them or hate them and there were lot of new yorker on both side of the issu the tower made a power statement to the world that said "this is new york a symbol of our free economi and of our way of life." that is whi they were destroy this is a second reason whi the tower must be replac and with build that make a potent architectur statement in recent week redevelop propos have been circul from mani sourc most of these focus not on the trade center site howev but on all of lower manhattan further mani believ that the number million squar feet either could be locat elsewher scatter in sever site or simpli never rebuilt these propos miss the point what was destroy and what must be recov was the trade center not all of lower manhattan except over the tower footprint where there must be no commerci develop the offic and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was access to mass transit make the site ideal for offic space of this size that was a major reason whi the twin tower were leas to percent occup befor number none of the other site propos for offic develop has remot equal transport access with the reconstruct of

york cannot reabsorb offic space that it previous had are say that the citi has had it day and is enter an extend period of stagnat and declin i will not accept this view nor will most new yorker mayor michael bloomberg said in a recent interview with the new york time that the citi "has to do two thing memori but also build for the future." i believ that the twin tower site can grace accommod
