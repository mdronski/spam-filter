 on number number percent sep number number at number number darragh wrote  the help that i receiv today then though i tri to build them i  start by tri the number program i use the follow line which produc  some strang result would ani one be abl to set me straight   ./configur --with-emac number --exec-prefix=/usr/  number --with-url=/url/url one thing i _think_ you might be do slight wrong is your specif of prefix --prefix is the directori to be use as root for _installing_ file typic packag use /usr/loc as default (so binari might then go in /usr/local/bin document in /usr/local/doc and so forth) normal i find it suffici to put --prefix=/usr/loc and do not further specifi thing like --exec-prefix mayb you have a special reason for use the prefix you chose in which case ignor me  that work fine so i move to the next step  make  at the bottem of the text i got the follow messag  cannot open load file /url/url/url-vars.el  number *** [custom-load.el] error number  number leav directori number  make *** number error number   when i got around to tri the url packag i had no problem in say  that this doesn't necessarili mean that i was do it right so below are  the command i use  ./configur --with-emac --prefix=/url/url --exec-prefix=/url/url i'd make the same remark about prefix here i would use the command ./configur --with-emac --prefix=/usr/loc to get number to compil i think the with-url flag you should use is --with-url=/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/ (assum you compiled/instal url with --prefix=/usr/loc sinc you appear to have instal url in /url/url configur number with ./configur --with-emac --prefix=/usr/local/ --with-url=/url/url/share/emacs/site-lisp a command you would have found use would have been find / -name url-vars.el -print which would have told you where the url-vars.el file was instal a program which is veri use is checkinstal URL it allow you to instal packag from sourc while still regist them in the packag manag system of your distro (rpm,deb,tgz) instead of "make install" type "checkinstall" and a packag is put togeth and instal for you make uninstal simpler than it might otherwis be -- michael conri number web URL key fingerprint = number number number number number number number number number number -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
