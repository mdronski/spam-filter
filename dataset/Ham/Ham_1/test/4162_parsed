(rememb to never ever ever power up your system without a heatsink & fan) if after reseat the cpu into the mobo.. you still get no beep code from it with just the cpu insert into the mobo ie(no pci,*isa card or and no actual ide or floppi cabl connect to the system).. even though you have power.. you either have a faulti motherboard or a faulti cpu onc you get beep code various permut of the abov should eventu disjunct which devic it is is caus the lack of post power on self test bod -- irish linux user group email URL for (un)subscript inform list maintain email
