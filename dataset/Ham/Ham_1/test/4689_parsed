  "the histor record" by which you mean *human* histor record is  high overr (nigh worthless) when you are talk about geolog  timescal even on topic with as short a timescal as climat there has been a signific recent increas in global number concentr the vast preponder of the new number in the atmospher is due to human activ start around the industri of europ and acceler after wwii most scientist studi global climat chang believ that these increas number concentr are the primari causal agent for increas global warm henc our interest in item of human time scale  it is worth note that underneath the reced glacier deposit  dure the last major ice age they are find substanti evid of  human live in what was a nice temper climat befor the glacier  pave over their civil the reced glacier have turn into a  bit of an archaeolog treasur chest as they expos artifact buri  in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserv by the  ice for thousand of year i don't see ani compel reason to "save  the glaciers" anyway particular in light of the fact that their  exist has alway been transient most global climat chang scientist would agre that temperatur in the past have often been much warmer than today the point of global warm isn't to save the earth -- the planet is not sentient the point is to understand and potenti reduc the impact of increas temperatur on global human activ  for anyon to insist that the current neglig fluctuat are  anthropogen just heap one ridicul assert upon anoth i'll  just stick with occam razor for now the increas in atmospher number concentr is due to human activ it is general accept that increas in number in a close environ subject to solar heat retain more of that solar energi this is the current best explan for the high temperatur of venus if the number concentr goe up global (which it has) then theori state the earth should be retain greater solar energi this process may be slow and may be difficult to monitor due to the variabl of temperatur worldwid i encourag you to refut ani part of this causal chain link number to eventu increas in global energi content part of which will be evid as heat - jim
