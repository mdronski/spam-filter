 is there a relat clean way to dynam build comp file base on the path of the current folder yeah i know exmh will pull the first comp in the path up from the current folder to the mail root but that not what i want i'm start to use plus address heavili as part of my spam control specif i each mail list with a list-specif address eg i would subscrib to this list as email or perhap email instead of email howev to do this i need a new set of comp file for each list folder as i'm subscrib to someth just over number list that rather a pain i realli don't want to go creat and maintain number comp file (compon replcomp replgroupcomps) especi not as i suspect i'll be chang or adapt my name pattern a few time as i adapt various support tool what would be great is if i could build the relev comp file dynam at runtim that way i don't need to maintain a coupl thousand comp file i just need to make my plus address predictable/comput base (say) on the folder path eg i'm current in folder +-lists-/products/exmh-l the script would dynam build a compfil which had a from of email for repl comp etc similar when in folder +-lists-/linux/svlug-l i'd get a from of email that way i can use lookup tabl for those folder which have multipl list be deliv into them ani idea how this might be done in an automatic/maintain fashion it would be more than good enough if all i had to do was drop a tini from_head file in each folder that somehow got pick up by the comp file.. -- j c lawrenc ---------(*) satan oscil my metal sonata email he live as a devil eh URL evil is a name of a foeman as i live _______________________________________________ exmh-us mail list email URL
