 "this is a veri tenuous time for microsoft," gartenberg said "this is not a time in microsoft histori when it can be seen as tri to do to real what it did to netscape." rrrrrrriiiiiight... number juli number number realnetwork pose challeng to microsoft by john markoff san francisco juli number -- in a signific challeng to microsoft realnetwork plan to announc a new version of it softwar on monday that can distribut audio and video in a rang of format includ microsoft own proprietari window media the new softwar is intend for larg media compani and other corpor that need to send audio and video data to custom and employe in a varieti of differ format but realnetwork acknowledg that it was possibl that the compani might incur microsoft legal wrath nevertheless rob glaser a former microsoft execut who found realnetwork as progress network in number said he believ the strategi was good for both microsoft and consum "a ration way for them to respond would be to say `this is great, " he said "that would be microsoft of the future." mr glaser said his compani base in seattl had develop a version of the microsoft media server softwar that come with the window oper system he said realnetwork engin had studi the data that was sent between the microsoft media server softwar and the window media player program and recreat the technolog need to play file in the microsoft format this method creat a so-cal clean-room version mean the develop built the transmiss softwar without ani knowledg about the under program microsoft has adopt a similar strategi at sever junctur mr glaser said reverse-engin technolog like netwar postscript and javascript at differ time microsoft execut said the compani current licens the window media player technolog to a varieti of compani includ yahoo realnetwork and the america onlin unit of aol time warner but a microsoft execut said that a clean-room copi of the window server technolog could lead to qualiti and perform issu "it kind of hard to specul about the technolog until we see it," said dave fester the general manag of the window media divis if a compani has not licens the server softwar he ad "we would need to look at it and see what they'r doing." realnetwork appear to be endeavor to avoid be "netscaped," a refer to the fate that befel the netscap communic corpor when microsoft decid to make an internet browser which was pioneer commerci by netscap a standard part of the window oper system netscap was later acquir by aol time warner microsoft decis to build an internet browser into window and give it away at no addit cost led direct to a bitter antitrust lawsuit brought by the justic depart in number realnetwork which was a pioneer in the market for stream media to desktop person comput has been under grow pressur from microsoft which is give away both the server and window media player program as part of it oper strategi realnetwork also face challeng from appl comput which offer the quicktim media player as a part of it macintosh os x oper system and sell a more full-featur player moreov in recent month macromedia inc. which make the flash anim softwar use on mani web site has ad video capabl to it technolog make it a potenti rival realnetwork is gambl that with a prolifer of differ standard and format for video and audio the media corpor that make content avail over the internet will flock to a singl system that support multipl type of data the compani is tri to shift the focus of the competit from the pc desktop to the server accord to analyst sever analyst said the realnetwork shift in strategi could put microsoft on the defens "real has got the experi and sophist to pull this off," said richard doherti the presid of envision a market research and consult firm base in seaford n.i "it will open up a new hors race." until now the compani have been engag in a technolog war to rapid increas the power and qualiti of each of their media player at the same time they have compet over which of the program are place on the desktop of person comput user realnetwork claim to have number subscrib for pay servic but it is perceiv as be increas vulner accord to some analyst becaus microsoft has includ it media player as part of the window oper system which domin the pc market there are dozen of data format for play audio and video on the internet but the domin one are realaudio and realvideo from realnetwork quicktim from appl window media from microsoft and the industri digit movi standard number and number microsoft and realnetwork are current lock in a close race for desktop media player leadership in the first quarter of this year accord to survey data collect by jupit research a market research firm base in new york realnetwork realon player had a number percent share of media player while microsoft window media player had a number percent share appl quicktim player was third with a number percent the new server softwar from realnetwork is part of a version of the compani media server that is to be introduc on monday and which will be call the helix univers server realnetwork said it would offer perform data base on a test it financ at an independ test servic keylab that indic that the helix softwar can under some condit deliv up to four time the speed of the window media server in microsoft oper system (softwar server are program that run on power comput and can send stream of digit inform to mani comput user simultaneously.) at a news confer schedul to be held in san francisco realnetwork is also expect to announc that it plan to make the helix softwar avail as part of a strategi known as communiti sourc which will make it possibl for realnetwork partner and competitor to take advantag of the origin programm instruct realnetwork is to announc a rang of partner includ hitachi hewlett-packard i.b.m. deutsch telekom nec nokia cisco system oracl sun microsystem palm texa instrument and other these partner could then incorpor the softwar into their own hardwar and softwar product under the licens strategi compani will be abl to freeli gain access to the under code that the helix program is base on but they will still pay a licens fee when they sell commerci product base on the technolog the community-sourc approach to softwar which was pioneer by sun to distribut it java program languag is a variat upon the origin free softwar or open-sourc approach which has confound the softwar industri in recent year while open-sourc softwar can be freeli share with some restrict the community-sourc approach is more restrict and yet still tri to persuad other to collabor and add innov idea other larg technolog compani includ sun i.b.m and appl have all now adopt variat on such open-sourc strategi with vari result in sun case the compani has been critic becaus while java has becom an industri standard the compani has not been the princip financi beneficiari in mani case realnetwork is tri to strike a balanc between open up it technolog to persuad other to particip and innov and not lose control of the technolog entir mr glaser said "we think we'v struck the balanc well," he said analyst said the strategi shift by realnetwork was like to shake up the industri "the moment you'v open-sourc someth you'v corner your competitor," said matthew berk an analyst a jupit research "to date this stuff has been veri proprietari open it up make it access to creativ and gift programm who will come up with wild stuff that the compani have never considered." mr glaser said he expect other compani to produc technolog that would rival realnetwork commerci as a result of the community-sourc strategi one possibl is that compani such as sun or i.b.m could decid to add the helix technolog of realnetwork as a standard compon of their oper system although realnetwork might not get a signific financi benefit from such an arrang it could contribut to make it helix softwar a de facto industri standard mr glaser said he had struck upon the idea of make his media server softwar open sourc while visit with an execut from nokia the world largest cellphon maker "take all of this stuff beyond the pc has been a huge motiv for us," he said when he realiz that nokia was interest in deploy the softwar technolog on as mani as number to number differ type of phone he realiz that realnetwork did not have enough program talent to support the effort "i told him `i don't think we have enough engin even if you guy were will to pay us, " he said that touch off a search for an altern way of have the two compani cooper number real take the open-sourc rout by jim hu staff writer cnet news.com juli number number number pm pt realnetwork on monday unveil a new open-sourc version of it stream media technolog that support multipl file format for audio and video includ those that use microsoft window media technolog the new campaign dub "helix," and first report by the new york time mark one of the most ambiti move in the compani histori realnetwork is simultan releas technolog without permiss that plug in to microsoft compet softwar and is rais the hood on much of it own softwar technolog to "open source" develop or anyon els who want to look the twin move rais the risk of lawsuit and renew competit -- potenti even from redmond wash.-bas microsoft itself onc it get a look under the hood at realnetwork technolog but it mark a dramat potenti way for a compani watch it market share diminish to regain momentum and support across an industri where mani other player remain skeptic of microsoft power "it a veri bold move on the part of real," said michael gartenberg a research director for analyst firm jupit research "this was a shot fire by real and fire direct at redmond." the move is the latest in a seri of strateg twist and turn that has made realnetwork one of the onli compani to surviv direct microsoft competit for year while the compani has expand into paid subscript content busi it softwar and stream media infrastructur have been under increas pressur from microsoft which has deem multimedia to be one of the major drive under the latest version of it window oper system real helix announc main involv the technolog that allow media file to move from place to place over the internet realnetwork and microsoft both produc server that allow video and audio to be stream from a content compani such as cnn or nbc to a person comput real has charg for this softwar while microsoft has given it away for free in april realmedia reach number million at-hom viewer compar with window media at number million and appl comput quicktim at number million accord to nielsen/netr at work window media drew about number million uniqu viewer compar with realmedia number million and quicktim number million real own new product call the univers server will allow one server to stream real technolog microsoft file appl comput quicktim and other most other compet product do not support competitor technolog "when you have all these differ platform and all these differ protocol it get unmanageable," realnetwork rob glaser said at a high-glitz press confer in san francisco announc the product "a lot of what (this technology) is about is break those bottleneck and make converg realli converge." to make the new product compat with microsoft file howev the compani pursu a riski strategi known as "revers engineering," in which develop examin a competitor product to see how it work and tri to creat someth that work just like it glaser said that engin work entir in a "clean room" environ mean that they had no access to actual microsoft code had they simpli copi code they could be liabl for patent infring the result product simpli mimic the way that microsoft file are sent across network and allow a window media player to receiv the file other compani have been su for simpli copi a competitor code and put it in their own product but realnetwork say it not worri about microsoft lawsuit becaus it took precaut to do all develop in the "clean room" environ microsoft itself has engag in this kind of legal revers engin analyst say microsoft which still face antitrust lawsuit is in no posit to sue in ani case "this is a veri tenuous time for microsoft," gartenberg said "this is not a time in microsoft histori when it can be seen as tri to do to real what it did to netscape." the influenti giant certain monday announc acknowledg microsoft influenc in media technolog someth glaser and real have often been loath to do microsoft was quick to spin monday announc as further valid of it strength in the marketplac "it an admiss of realnetwork that it import for them to support window media and that we'r now the lead player among home and work users," said michael aldridg lead product manag for microsoft window digit media divis aldridg ad that realnetwork current has a licens agreement for it media player to support window audio and video format howev realnetwork and microsoft do not have an agreement to allow the server to deliv window media format to end user which is what realnetwork tri to do aldridg declin to comment on realnetwork replic of microsoft technolog in addit to it own new product real has promis to give away sourc code to much of the under technolog for stream media that stop short of the actual file format or "codec" itself but will provid the open-sourc communiti and other compani with power new tool to build their own stream media player or softwar glaser said he wouldn't initi make the softwar code that mimic microsoft stream avail but that he was consid the idea a first chunk of code under the realnetwork multimedia player softwar will be releas in number day other code includ the basic function of it stream media server and encod will be releas by the end of the year the compani said the compani plan to reveal it sourc code--th basic instruct under the software--echo similar move made by netscap communic to defend against microsoft in march number netscap took the bold step of open it sourc code to allow softwar develop to help creat the next generat of it popular browser jame barksdal then ceo of netscap said the move would allow the compani to "tap into a virtual unlimit develop talent pool." instead the effort which has evolv into the mozilla.org project hit consider roadblock and microsoft overtook netscap in market share ---- email -- .sig doubl play we have done a great job of have team work around the clock to deliv secur fix for ani problem that aris our
