 date sun number sep number number number from brent welch email message-id email  i would encourag folk to play with those number line of code in  text_select and report what work well for them we may come up  with number line that work for everyon or perhap introduc yet anoth  set that let folk choos between a few use model of cours  that an admiss of polici failur but i'm will to do that i actual think you'r look in the wrong place i at least have almost no problem with the choic of what get past or select that stuff (for me if perhap not user of some gnome variant which appraent has been fix anyway) all seem to work just fine the problem is that a button number click clear the select (primary) where it shouldn't - the previous select should onli be clear when there someth els to replac it (even if the highlight of what is select is removed) tri this in ani other ramdom applic (from xterm to netscape) and see how it work there normal is *no* (mous based) way to actual clear the primari select (that is set it to be a null string) then becaus of the "if i get ask for the select valu i will find something" behaviour if you click (intend to set the insert point the way most other gui operate) and then past becaus the primari is clear but exmh still own the select becaus noth els has taken it it doe and find some other ramdom stuff from either the clipboard or cut buffer which tend to be someth that was delet back in the ancient past and past that that behaviour to me anyway is the real issu onc that get fix we can switch back to oper the normal "select stuff click at new insert point paste" mode of oper that almost everyon expect to work (whether the "select stuff" is somewher in one of the exmh window or elsewhere) kre ps this messag is from my experi as a exmh user onli i'v never realli understood enough about x and select to go gaze at that part of the code and see how it all realli oper _______________________________________________ exmh-us mail list email URL
