instead you simpli revert  to base state on reboot obvious you can't do this with partit that  accru import state e.g a partit that store databas tabl data  but in your typic web applic most partit do not accru import  state for exampl your typic web server or applic server could have  their entir state reset back to a known base state dure each reboot  without harm  the advantag of be less ambiti is that we have a quick and easi way  to frustrat certain attack without rewrit all of our softwar or  spend lot of money on addit application-specif code   the first two problem you describ onli occur if we becom more ambiti  and tri to appli these same techniqu to for exampl the databas tabl  partit where state chang remain import across reboot that would  certain be a nice touch but as you point out mani problem would have to  be address first and the hardest of these can not be abstract away from  the particular applic not the least of these is the problem of write  heurist for delin good from malevol state that task is rough  analog to what antivir softwar author do for a live onli this work  could not be share across mani differ system as it would be specif to  a paritcular applic   the third problem you mention - perform penalti - is an argument for  do this in hardwar much like hardwar raid anoth argument for do  this in hardwar is hack resist chang the base instanc should  requir physic access to the consol e.g by requir that you first  flip a physic switch on your raid hardwar or modifi a bio set if  the base imag can be modifi remot or by softwar then you have to  worri about whether an implement flaw might permit a cracker to modifi  the base imag remot   ben -- ( ______ )) .-- scott mackenzi dine colleg isd --    phone/voic mail number    o    \--- senior dba/car coordinator/etc --/  _  `-- `- email email -' `-----
