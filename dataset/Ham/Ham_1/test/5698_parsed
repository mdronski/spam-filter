  yeah that exact what i was doing--i didn't realiz i was  incur administr pickl bloat this way i'm specif  tri to make thing faster and smaller so i'm store individu  wordinfo pickl into an anydbm dict (key by token) the result  is that it almost number time faster to score messag one per run  our of procmail number vs number this is veri worthwhil  howev it *does* say all over the place that the goal of this  project isn't to make the fastest or the smallest implement so  i guess i'll hold off do ani further perform tune until the  goal start to point more in that direct number second is probabl  fast enough for peopl to use it in their procmailrc which is what  i was after mayb i batch messag use fetchmail (don't ask why) and ad number second per messag for a batch of number (not untypical) feel like a real wait to me.. --guido van rossum (home page URL
