 on wed number jul number email wrote  hey meybe by then bush grand plan for a missl defens system will  actual pan out and -work- .. hey that thing is number km across and number km/s fast there noth you can do just befor the impact with a system that was design to deal with tini ballist missil and larg by damag them not destroy them apart from twiddl with the surfac albedo which might be not enough -- we current don't have ion drive with enough power or at least we can't develop and deploy them on time so that onli leav you with nuke assymetr repeat flash-evapor (anyth closer would risk fragment it) on rock of unknown composit (could be a pile of rubbl for all what we know) has never been tri yet though  i'm not hold my breath but i'm not go to panic for someth that  a littl under number year away either it is much more interest whether you can kill enough of delta v for a captur but here tri to brake a smaller object (say few number m across) with final stage aerobrak would be far more use otoh one could as well could invest that effort into a launch capac on the moon URL
