-------------------------------------------------------- speech at tti vanguard "design for resiliency" confer number by bruce sterl late last month i had the joy and privileg of hang out with a big crowd of american comput scientist who were basic tri to find some reason to live despit all evid to the contrari they'v definit got some reason when you go to a confer which is veri high-energi with a lot of paradigmat reassess go on where idea are be flung around bodili well outsid the box well that an impress thing but it my principl as a sometim work journalist not to get all carri away whenev i wit someth like that they might well be drink their own bathwat this sort of thing general requir a realiti check from some *other* confer so i'm now fresh back from colorado from the year meet of the high ground design convers these are my best pal in the industri design world some dear long-tim friend of mine whose judgment i alway trust and whi would a scienc fiction writer trust the judgment of industri design well becaus they'r veri *trendy.* they'r veri shrewd and veri stylish and veri hands-on peopl they'r peculiar self-effac and modest yet quit imagin better yet they'r even practic so they'r kind of like scienc fiction writer onli with much better shoe usual when i go to this high ground event i just deliv some wacko chat about popular aspect of cybercultur and then i take some worship note but i have to report that when i took them my note from the "cra grand challeng in computation" confer i was bring the nois this is the first time i have ever seen their jaw drop they'r still kinda wring their hand over the dotcom boom and the ka-boom they miss those glori day of the world wide web == becaus for them that was the graphic design full employ act so they'r pretti broke and they'r a littl shell-shock so i guess they should join the club but when i brought them *this* stuff == a rather extens worked-out vision in worldbuild from the point of view of ubiquit comput in the number century.. well of cours this is mere a scenario but to me number smell like the futur and frank it doesn't smell good but that all right becaus these aren't good time these are rather harsh dark time and in it own peculiar way number is a similar harsh dark concept "ubiquit computation" is by no mean a new idea the guy who invent the term is dead and even his r&d lab doesn't look all that great these day ubicomp has been around for quit some time == in the table-napkin handwav stage but it lack the mean motiv and opportun to get ani real-world traction i believ that may be chang if so it most due to the event of septemb number after that experi ubicomp has got motiv and opportun as it never had befor and the mean although they are still specul are start to make some sens what am i talk about when i use the term "ubicomp" well the term is a grab-bag a congel of differ technolog some are here commerci avail off the shelf some are in the lab and some may be physic imposs let get down to some brass virtual tack what are the key technic driver for wide distribut self- organ network of sensor processor and actuat embed in the physic world and what do you do with these thing okay number one fuel cell not chemic batteri small portabl depend long-last power sourc with some punch they may not be fuel cell as they are now known they might be mem fuel cell or aluminum-air cell or someth enzymat i don't care just someth much much better than today batteri portabl power is the crux ubicomp futur if it has one entir hing on this if we don't get some serious advanc portabl sourc of power then everyth i am about to tell you is a sci-fi phantasm (not that there anyth wrong with that!) number two rfid radio-frequ id == gotta have some tagger gotta be on the net it'd be nice if they had some power processor in them someth intern pervas a littl comput action that is go on insid physic object number three wireless broadband get real close here number four dongl i think this part is serious underappreci this is the weird part of ubicomp the part that may turn out to be it achill heel some way to turn the damn thing off and to *know* it off the problem of the author user the author administr the author access this is like to play out as ubicomp function equival of the internet intellectual-properti problem in other word it a veri serious issu which is go to be neglect from the get-go as peopl are eager build the basic infrastructur then as they lame tri to build it in later they are go to find out that they have inadvert poison the water-stream for everybodi you don't want to wander into a kazaa and napster version of georg orwel ubiquit comput unlik inform doe not "want to be free." this is not a technolog of freedom ubiquit comput want to make you it slave tri to rememb that for all our sake all right this is not a water-cool for gossip like the internet is this is a hard-cas hard-tim hands-on rather ruthless command-and-control system number five gps global posit system been there done that number six convoy traffic i think this is also underestim for when i start look at serious applic for ubicomp time and again rapid ship larg amount of physic materi in and out of the ubicomp zone is a killer applic get stuff in number it assembl it move it out lot of it train load truck load bus load and airlift bring up the van a whole bunch of other ubi-stuff of vari degre of use and practic high speed fiber optic network check massiv storag and router check big databas check but they need to be fast and flexibl some "mobihoc" action mobil ad-hoc self- assembl network network that are alway reconfigur in real-tim alway on the move facial recognit has a consider number of ubicomp applic by no mean all of them good human presence-sens system oh yes rugged hardwar suitabl for outdoor deploy in all condit and weather real-tim simul of ongo major situat toxin detector of various kind environment monitor of almost everi sort biometr id.. i have a long list of these i'm cross-check them i'm use them to build scenario one thing about number make it veri distinct from earlier vision of ubicomp this is not microsoft window for housekeep this is a hard tough web that you throw down fast over dire emerg the key concept here is that we are final move comput out of the ivori tower for good and all no more glass box of the number no more clean abstract of cyberspac we are deploy comput at unheard-of speed into the darkest dirtiest most danger place in the world it is a resili secur apparatus for emerg that is number now you might well argu that ubicomp is veri invas of privaci that just what my industri design pal said about it immedi and they were right it been hard to find reason deploy for ubicomp in peacetim commerc and in privat home becaus it is so orwellian howev under certain circumst other social circumst do trump this issu for instanc when you are breath your last under a pile of earthquak rubbl you don't realli care much about privaci under your circumst what you realli want is a smart bulldoz a tourniquet and some direct pressur against your open wound and that is what number is about == or will be about should it find it way out of the computer-sci talking-shop and into daylight it is an emerg respons system for the planet open wound and those wound exist in plenti there are more of them all the time i rather doubt that the orwellian version of ubicomp has much of a futur that a scenario that i have dub "terrorspace" which is ubicomp in the context of airport and nuclear power site if you'v been in airport recent i believ you are see a pretti apt earli version of terrorspac at ani random moment you can have your possess rifl through by stranger your shoe are scan and various small but vital object in your pocket can be confisc by semi- educ secur geek they'r either pathet under-train for the job (in which case you certain feel no safer) or els they are intellig and capabl peopl (in which case you piti them and wish they had some other job for the sake of general human happi and the gnp) rather than make us ani safer terrorspac airport serv as polit indoctrin center that humili our vote popul on a broad scale they are meant to inur us to ever-escal level of government clumsi and general harm the difficulti with this terrorspac approach is that airport and airlin are go broke airport are hemorrhag money tri to maintain this terrorspac apparatus it is like to spread to the brittl power of nuclear power plant nuclear wast dump bio-sit chemic site liquid petroleum gas center and so forth that will huge increas the overhead of all these danger industri that a veri consider tax burden so though terrorspac may serv as a full employ program for the loyal and slight stupid that not go to pay off social or econom in the long run howev number is a differ matter an air- deploy number that allow first respond to rapid deal with fire flood and other major disast would *save* money especi for the insur who are alreadi on the rope the actual septemb number event number was a rare and remark thing and with fewer than number peopl dead it just not that big a deal as genuin catastroph go polit theolog and militarili it was huge but a workaday number wouldn't fret much about terror instead it would have to deal most with flood fire climat chang earthquak volcano and (let hope never) asteroid and weapon of mass destruct so basic with number we are describ a social re-definit of comput geek as firemen nativ twenty-first centuri comput geek as muscular with-it first-respond type i think this would be pretti good for the comput industri we all need to take the dysfunct physic world far more serious this week itali flood texa is flood colorado on fire this morn the brand-new wilder forest around the site of the former chernobyl are on fire spew radioact ash hither and yon chunk of antarctica the size of rhode island have fallen into the sea i could go on this is the sort of activ that human is requir to deal with in this new centuri if we build a success method with which to do this those use tactic will spread across the fabric of our civil i believ they are alreadi spread an innov like number will like serv as a camel nose in the tent for a whole seri of ubicomp applic across societi i'v been specul about these new form of ubicomp and give them some flashi neolog becaus that is what scienc fiction writer bring to the tabl we build littl scenario world and make up name for them first we'v got number then "terrorspace," but there are other battlespac a term alreadi much-us by the pentagon battlespac mean militari number the "revolut in militari affairs." i would point out that the militari unlik some sector is not reneg on their enthusiast commit to the digit revolut on the contrari i haven't seen anybodi in the militari say that they long to go back to the good-old-fashion solid easy-to- understand method of the war in vietnam the militari are veri into "network-centr warfare," and they couldn't be happier about their spysat and surveil drone prosthet ubicomp this is eldercar a huge steadili grow market alzheim diseas is a flat-out domest catastroph that last seven year ani comput help here == in elder-proof space track the sick and so forth == would be of huge benefit to societi cradle.net babi have no privaci children have littl privaci child-proof a room against a crawl tot.. if you'v ever done this you can realiz how much use it might be to have this process autom ani two-year-old alway wonder "whi can't mr fork and miss wall socket be friends?" a real-tim checklist at the veri least and then we'r face with the interest large-scal prospect of number street.net this would be traffic manag and urban system manag water network power network subway sidewalk and so forth punish.net two million peopl are in the american prison popul they'v got no privaci they'v gotta be watch all the time they'r basic cram in iron cage now industri ubicomp manag suppli chain industri assembl and so forth this will eventu be the biggest applic so/ho ubicomp ubicomp in the home the home offic and small offic some veri interest consum use here but in the grand scheme of thing not that big a deal safetyspac these would be militari base u.n safeti zone refuge camp and disast evacu center it fair easi to imagin ubiquit comput as a sinist "gate community" that wall off privileg area under threat but we can also think of it as import some human comfort solidar merci and safeti into various benight area that are sever disturb one can imagin a gorazd un safe zone version of this new and improv of cours a black helicopt ghost over in the dead of night deploy a scatter of small drone smart-min and sensor and sudden the war just stop within these bound of safetyspac rapin loot sack smash and burn are rule out of exist through comput awar the handi of a techniqu like that for life in the number century.. well it might be a bit underestim and last come up with a bullet should the good time return in all their carefre glori ubitopia this i take to be ubicomp as an urban entertain destin you go there for fun just becaus there is cool wacki stuff embed in the physic world and it behav in a way that bring joy and hilar and good spirit like the funhous mirror at a digit carniv when and if ubitopia realli hit it will mean that human basic relationship with our materi good has been radic redefin that is the apotheosi of ubiquit comput just materi good and the way we deal with them are differ differ in charact differ in qualiti not recogniz by number centuri standard so i have no idea if the homeland secur depart or fema or darpa or the nsf are go to poni up ani money for ani of these notion that not my lookout i'm a scienc fiction writer and ladi and gentlemen with this materi i have struck platinum this stuff is realli hot this is a great attract contemporari idea that is realli new realli differ and realli omin the implic are huge and they spread across the board of societi i am go to be a veri busi guy with this materi if you want to help me send some email thank a lot for your attent o=c=o o=c=o o=c=o it here it there it everywher o=c=o o=c=o o=c=o
