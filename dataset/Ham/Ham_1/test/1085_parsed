  er i understood you until you reach the abov mayb it my lack of  php but whi would a variabl name _need_ to end with []    with most languag you pars the submit form data and should come  out with either variabl or an array / hash which you then work with  and name whatev you like iirc if the queri string contain varname=first&varname=second then php will creat a variabl call "varname" with result second howev if the queri string contain varname[]=first&varname[]=second then php will creat an array with number and number there are other way to get the data from the URL request and i guess i'll do that if it turn out to simplifi the script that creat the form but as i understand it that the "official" way to get data from a select multipl use php dave _______________________________________________ webdev mail list email URL
