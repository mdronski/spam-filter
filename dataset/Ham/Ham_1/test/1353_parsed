 first number peopl will have seen the piec of spam that could'v been avoid but the other number will never see that spam even distribut it mean that an averag user will onli see percent of spam that not realist becaus not everyon will get the same spam but the basic threshold can be adjust at the veri least number peopl need to "vote" on a given piec of mail to make a realist decis sinc there no "no" vote mechan (except revocation--and that after the fact) onli a "yes" vote mechan exist and so if you receiv number "yes" vote then you could safe say that you got a reason sampl the system could pretend to have never seen the piec of mail until after it determin that it was probabl spam so instead of a rate go up increment it would take a big leap at the begin (from undefin to a relat high number) and then go from there so after the first group of peopl (our sampler we'll say) have seen the spam no one els would ever see it as far as unsubscrib i'm alway leeri of click on the link (and don't do so unless i specif rememb sign up for something) but the sampl popul will decid for themselv whether they feel that it spam so ultim i guess i'm say that the most effect rout would be to use a constant chang sampl pool and just accept that there is some fraction of user that will have to see the spam in a system that depend on peopl decid whether or not someth is spam is there ani other way isaac -----origin message----- from patrick sent wednesday august number number number pm to oat isaac cc email subject re [razor-users] mani vs one on wed number aug number oat isaac wrote  i'm new to razor but have studi trust system befor i'v been follow  the thread about tes and have a few thought   first a more complex algorithm is not alway better as soon as you start  account for edg case in what should otherwis be a general  algorithm general perform begin to degrad exponenti the  thing that razor should have go for it is number say that razor  has number peopl that activ use it (i.e click the "spam" button on  their mail reader from time to time.) if we decid that our object  is to screen percent of spam it mean that we can continu to show what  appear to be a piec of spam to number peopl and still meet our  object   whi not just wait for number peopl to vote that a piec of mail is inde  spam befor ever acknowledg that it could potenti be spam in  other word when i razor-report a messag should i be abl to tell  that razor has ever even seen that messag becaus you then have a system that is ineffect to a vari degre a simplist view would be that number subscrib receiv a piec of spam that could have otherwis been avoid but the realiti is like that mani mani more individu would have receiv the piec of spam when you factor in report time  by have the server pretend to never have seen it you can avoid  peopl who just re-report spam becaus it was alreadi mark as spam  someth that is complet useless wrong razor-check will tell you if a specif piec of mail match someth alreadi in the databas if you have the system pretend to have never seen a piec of mail how do you propos peopl use the system for filter  what about revoc a revoc is after the fact becaus a  substanti number of peopl number in this example) have alreadi  decid that they do not want that messag if it is mark as spam by  all those peopl and then peopl start revok it what doe that  mean  it mean that the revok have an opinion that probabl doesn't mesh  with the major no it mean that the peopl do the revok have a differ opinion than the number peopl who have submit it as spam rather the number peopl who have report the messag as spam constitut a major or not is someth that would have to be determin in the context of the individu messag  instead of mess with it rate whi not just put  it on the whitelist if i want that zdnet mail and most peopl think  that zdnet mail is just plain annoy then whi can't i whitelist it  instead of "arguing" with everyon about whether or not it spam you alway have that abil  correct me if i'm wrong but it not as if all mail from zdnet will be  ban in the future-just that one piec so if zdnet were to chang  it system to make it easier to opt out or whatev peopl would hope  start unsubscrib instead of click the "spam" button it my opinion that it not my job to unsubscrib to ani list that i haven't subscrib to nor is it necessarili in my best interest given that some parti send unwant communic may util the unsubscrib request as a method of determin they are mail a valid address  the inher problem here of cours is that someon can pretend to be  number peopl and block anyth they choos but say you still have a  lightweight trust system built in where when they "agree" with the  major (though they couldn't have known becaus razor hadn't  acknowledg anyth yet) then your trust rate goe up and vice  versa   the key here is that in order to be reliabl you need the number what  am i miss here see abov
