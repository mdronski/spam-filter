email  email email  subject revolut os is now author for uc santa cruz screen   to all   i have read the seri of e-mail relat to the unauthor uc santa  cruz screen that was schedul for june number i sincer appreci  ieee good faith effort to correct the mistak   consequ so as not to inconveni the peopl plan to attend  the screen i want to give ieee and sluglug permiss to screen  revolut os at number pm on june number i would ask the member of svlug to  hold off on attend the screen for the simpl reason that i am  tri to get revolut os book into the camera number in san jose and i  would prefer that svlug member have a chanc to see a nice number print  of the film if my distributor is unabl to book the film into a  theater in the bay area i promis that i will work with svlug to  quick set up a screen for it member   i realiz there may be some member of sluglug who are unhappi that i  origin request that they not hold an unauthor screen of  revolut os there are sever reason whi i made the request and  none of them have anyth to do with me want to be a jerk   one sluglug member comment that it was odd that a movi about the open  sourc movement would not be avail for open view anoth  sluglug member remark that my request smack of bill gate open letter  to hobbyist   the bottomlin is that i did make a film about the open sourc movement  but to assum that automat mean that the film is itself open  sourc seem to be a littl bit of a stretch if i made a movi about  the histori of vegetarian that would not automat mean i'm a  vegetarian   i simpli thought open sourc and free softwar were compel subject  worth explor and document as a result i came to admir mani  aspect of the open sourc movement and chose to focus the documentari  on the movement posit histori howev i do not think i should be  punish for tell the stori of free softwar and open sourc by  have my intellectu properti misappropri more practic my  feel about open sourc revolut os are abund clear when you  see the explicit copyright notic at the end of the film credit   i realiz that make a videotap copi for person use from a tv air  is consid fair use i believ in a healthi fair use doctrin  howev there is a big differ between view your person copi at  home with a few friend and hold a public advertis screen on a  univers campus so i freeli admit my object to unauthor  screen of revolut os doe echo bill gate letter person i  believ that the creator of a piec of intellectu properti should  retain the choic to open sourc their ip if the open sourc movement  is not voluntari then it is realli just piraci   one of the reason i am concern with unauthor group screen of  the film is that my distributor is plan in a few week to begin  sell vhs copi of the film for educational/institut use with a  licens permit noncommerci larg group screen we hope to use  the money from these sale to fund the author and replic of the  dvd i want to releas the dvd as soon as possibl but i cannot afford  to take on anymor revolut os-rel debt thus the import of  preserv the educational/institut market   frequent i will read comment on slashdot and other mail list  that justifi the piraci of music on the ground that it benefit the  artist and onli hurt the greedi record label well in the case of  revolut os there is no multin media conglomer to punish  it just me i made and financ the film on my own i have work  full-tim for almost three year without a salari the onli way i will  get out of debt and have a chanc to make anoth film is if peopl seek  out legal opportun to view revolut os   i truli appreci the enthusiasm of the open sourc communiti for  revolut os and i am grate that peopl do want to see it if you  will just bare with me i will figur out a way for all interest  person to legal view it   i hope the dust up over the unauthor and now author screen  at uc santa cruz has not inconvenienc anyon   sincer   j.t.s moor  director revolut os  -- irish linux user group social event
