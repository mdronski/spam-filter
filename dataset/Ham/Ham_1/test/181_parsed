 reza b'far wrote  thread kind of surpris me.. i start code with c then c++ and  on to java.. and i think that look like a case of "mi experi is comprehens your is anecdot they don't know what they'r talk about" number the peopl who pay the wage don't give a flyin heck what program  you write thing in.. they just want it to work in my experi they do care it has to work certain and in particular it has to work with what they'v alreadi got and it has to work on client system my limit experi of java start a few year ago when support on linux was so terribl that i ran away scream and haven't come back yet microsoft has announc that they plan to remov java from window they took it out of xp alreadi and it has to be instal with a servic pack somehow i can't imagin them remov the abil to run c program number c and c++ forc the develop to solv problem such as memori  over and over again can't say i spend ani notic amount of time on memori manag issu apart from the fact that i frequent need  number gb  about design pattern architectur high level stuff.. if your problem just requir applic of a "design pattern" to solv then it trivial anyway irrespect of languag  am amaz by the amount of time wast by peopl talk about low  problem that have been solv number million time over and over  over again.. you appear to be gratuit assert that c programm wast time on irrelev low-level problem and java programm don't depend entir on the programm not the languag number java is not just a program languag it also a platform.. buzzword  monolith set of api or a crap load of differ api slice  dice the same problem number differ way unsupport assert number if you have a program of ani type of high complex written in c you  possibl think that you could port it to differ platform within  same magnitud of cost as java... dunno e.g. i port a wee number c program to darwin on powerpc in a few minut yesterday sure if it was bad design it would be number time the size and harder to port if it depend on unavail librari it would be much harder portabl code is easi to port at least that is the case when then languag you use is avail on the target platform i also run on arm system with no proper java number make no sens for a scientif or a busi project to depend on a  java imho reduc the depend of these entiti on the  develop as it is much easier to revers engin java as it is  revers engin c (larg applications) you can pay a good programm to solv your problem now or els get some kid to hack spaghetti fortran in ani languag and then pay for mainten headach ad infinitum number hardwar is get so fast that i'm not sure if the perform  between java and c/c++ are relev ani more whoah!! perform matter to me everi day (right now i'm take time out to write email while wait for a job to run) sure i could wait number year until everyon pc is fast enough to generat random ec in no time when ani twit will be abl to program ineffici code that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitor or i can do it now when veri few peopl can  end goal is the scientif or busi problem to be solv yes  for those problem languag such as java smalltalk and other  you to think more high level than low level think of bit  byte take too much gray matter away from the real import  it true i admit everyth mea maxima culpa work in c make me spend all day think base rank thought about hard-cor bitographi not actual i spend most of my time think in high-level mathemat  do most comput scientist insist on solv the same problem  and over again [...] dunno and frank i don't see the relev to the issu at hand i'm sure java is fine for some stuff as is c or whatev hors for cours bye rob .- .- / \ .- .- / \ / \ / \ .- _ .- / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / `- `- \ / \ / \ \ / `- `- \ / `- `-
