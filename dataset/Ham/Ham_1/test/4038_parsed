 url number date not suppli feedback from my number about number setup fell into four categori *"whi make setup revers instead you should collect all the inform from the user and make all the chang in one batch at the end."* there are a coupl of thing to understand here first of all even if you do everyth in one batch at the end there alway a possibl that some step in the middl of the batch will fail and in that case a well-behav setup program will back out the step that were alreadi done there are well over number error messag in the string tabl for fogbugz setup so the number of thing that can fail is not insignific second it not nice to tell peopl about an error in their input three page after they made the mistak for exampl earli in the fogbugz setup process we prompt you to creat an account for fogbugz to use [img URL (fogbugz setup screenshot)] the account creation could fail for a myriad of reason none of which can be predict befor tri to creat the account for exampl the password might not conform to the system password polici and differ nation version of window nt have differ rule about accent letter in password (betcha didn't know that!) it better to tell the user about this problem right away so they can correct their input rather than have a messag come up dure the long instal process later forc the user to back up and fix it and even if you forc the user to back up and fix it you still have to undo the first part of the work that you did befor creat the account otherwis you'v left their system in an indetermin state in ani case i need to write code to creat the account and delet the account in case someth later fail i might as well call that code on this page of the wizard where i can display a use error messag and what are the kind of thing that need to be revers well in order to upgrad fogbugz without requir a reboot (and we _never ever _requir a reboot) we have to shut down a coupl of process that might have been keep fogbugz file pin down such as ii (microsoft web server) so part one of the batch is "stop iis." now if part number fail for some reason it would be _extremely_ rude to leav ii not run and anyway it not like i don't need to write the code for "start iis" for the end of the batch so the code to rollback "stop iis" is alreadi written no big deal i just need to call it at the right place i think one reason that peopl think you should "gather all the info and then do all the work" is becaus with veri larg instal program that are veri slow this is a polit way to wast less of the user time inde even fogbugz setup doe percent of it work at the veri end but the "creat account" oper is so fast that principl simpli doesn't appli here even our percent of the work phase take well under a minut most of which is spent wait for ii to stop and start *"whi did you use vc++/mfc sure an advanc intellig such as yourself has admit by now that number is more productive."* first of all leav your languag religi fanatic at the usenet door somehow i manag to figur out_ in high school_ that languag advocaci and religi argument are unbeliev bore second even if delphi were more product the onli pertin question sinc i am write the code is _what is more product for joel spolsky_ and i don't know delphi at all but i know number mfc and vc++ _realli realli well_ so while i might not outcod a good delphi programm i would definit outcod a complet inexperienc delphi programm (which is me) certain over a short number week project third mani of the thing i need to do in this setup program are thing like "grant the logon as servic privileg to an account." this is rare enough that the onli way to find out how to do this is to search the microsoft knowleg base and the web in general when you search the web in general for how to do fanci thing with window nt what you find is about percent c code mayb percent vb code and percent everyth els yes i know i could translat the c code into delphi (assum i was a sophist delphi programm not a complet inexperienc delphi programmer) but that cost as much product as i would suppos gain from your suppos more product program languag and fourth i alreadi had about percent of the code i need for setup in mfc format from fogbugz number setup and a librari i'v been use for year to make wizard *"whi make setup at all you alreadi have your custom money good setup program don't increas sales."* this was actual the smartest question and made me think the hardest i came up with three reason - decreas tech support cost this setup program will pay for itself over the life of the code - delight my custom when i'm tri to get them to upgrad to number i want them to rememb how painless the number instal was so they won't hesit becaus they are afraid to upgrad i'm still use an old version of spamassassin that is becom increas ineffect even though i know the new version is much better becaus i just can't bear the thought of anoth morn wast the veri memori of the first spamassassin instal -- all the littl ssh window some su'e tri to scroll through man page and googl group accident hit ctrl+z in emac to undo and have it suspend tri to guess whi we can't get the mta to run procmail sorri it too much if spamassassin was make money off of upgrad they would have lost my busi becaus they don't have a setup program -
