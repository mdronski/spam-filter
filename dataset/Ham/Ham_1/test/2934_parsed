  "sm" == skip montanaro email write  put anoth way i'd be interest to hear whi you don't  want to use zodb  disclaim i'm not say i don't want to use zodb i'm  offer some reason whi it might not be everyon obvious  choic but you'r not say you do want to use zodb so you'r still part of the problem   for most of us who have *any* experi with zodb it probabl  all indirect via zope so there are probabl some inaccur  percept about it these thought that have come to my mind  at one time or anoth  * how could a databas from a compani (zope) whose sole busi  is not databas be more reliabl than a databas from  organ whose sole raison d'etr is databas  (sleepycat postgr mysql ...) i don't think i could argu that zodb is more reliabl that berkeleydb it true that we have fewer databas expert and expend fewer resourc work on databas reliabl on the other hand barri is near finish with a berkeleydb-bas storag for zodb zodb is an object persist tool that use a databas behind it you can use our filestorag or you can use someon els databas although berkeleydb is the best we can offer at the moment (it would be realli cool to do a postgr storage...)  * deal with zope monolith system is frustrat to peopl  (like me) who are use to have file resid in  filesystem some of that frustrat probabl carri  over to zodb though it almost certain not zodb  problem this sound like a zope complaint that doesn't have anyth to do with zodb but mayb i misunderstand you you don't have to store your code in the databas although that will be most possibl in number serious zodb store object pickl in a databas the storag layer is free to manag those pickl howev it like filestorag use a singl file tobi dickenson directorystorag repres each pickl as a separ file  * it seem to grow without bound els whi do i need to pack my  data.f file everi now and then it grow without bound unless you pack it whi is that a problem berkeleydb log file grow without bound too databas requir some tend one possibl with filestorag is to add an explicit pack() call to updat train oper we'd need to think care about the perform impact  also there is the issu of avail while it just an  extra instal it use requir more than the usual python  instal have it in the core distribut would provid  stronger assur that it run wherev python run (e.g.  doe it run on maco number or number both of which i believ jack still  support with his mac installer?) i think we'd want a spambay instal that packag up spambay python and zodb jeremi _______________________________________________ spambay mail list email URL
